<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:3em;margin-bottom:2em;font-size:2.5em;'>Tom Swift and His Airline Express</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch1'>CHAPTER I<br/> <span class='sub-head'>SOMETHING QUEER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Ours is sure a great plant!” murmured Tom
Swift to himself, with justifiable pride. “It
would be a credit to anybody. No wonder dad
loves it, and so do I. Yes, it sure is a great
plant! We’ve had our troubles—our ups and
downs—and our enemies have tried their hardest
to wipe it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Darkness was slowly gathering over the landscape,
shrouding in velvety black the trees
which were faintly stirring in the summer
breeze. Tom, following an old-time cowpath
across the green meadow on his way home from
town, topped a little rise and caught a glimpse
of the high board fence surrounding the Swift
Construction Company’s plant which he and his
father had built up after many years of hard work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom paused for a moment to trace, in the
fast-gathering shadows of the night, the outlines
of the various buildings—the foundry, the
wood-working mill, the electrical shop, the
hangars where many types of aircraft were
housed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From some of the tall chimneys faint clouds
of smoke arose, for certain of the industries
carried on by the Swift Construction Company
required that furnaces be kept going day and
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great plant—a wonderful plant!” mused
Tom. It gave him a certain sense of pleasure
to dwell thus in introspection on the accomplishments
of his father and himself. And it buoyed
him up for the work in prospect—for Tom Swift
had a great plan in mind, a plan so great
and daring that, as yet, he had said but little
of it even to his father or to Ned Newton,
his old chum who was now an officer of the
concern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it can be done! I know it can be done!”
declared Tom. “And I’m going to do it! I’m
going to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his mental energy he had unconsciously
spoken the last words in a low voice, but the
sight of something just ahead of him in the
gathering darkness caused him to break off
abruptly and halt suddenly. Concentrating
his gaze, Tom Swift looked eagerly at a clump
of bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a man,” murmured Tom Swift. “A
man, sure enough, and it isn’t one of our workers,
either. None of them would sneak around as
he is doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For that described exactly the movements
of the stranger of whom Tom had caught sight
in the darkness as he approached the big fence
which surrounded his plant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s he up to?” mused Tom. “No good,
that’s sure. He wouldn’t sneak along like that
if he were on the level.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through Tom’s mind flashed remembrances
of times when attempts had been made by
enemies of himself and his father to fire the
plant. To prevent this, and to keep strangers
away, a high fence had been erected around the
buildings. This fence was protected by wires
on the plan of a burglar alarm, so that, no
matter at what point the barrier was climbed,
a bell would ring in the main office and on an
indicator would appear a number to show at
what part of the fence an attempt was being
made to scale it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An effort to break down the barrier, or burrow
beneath it, would also sound the alarm in like
manner. So Tom had no fear that the sneaking
stranger, crouching along in the darkness, could
get into the midst of the buildings without
notice being given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’s his game?” thought Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost at the instant he asked himself this
question he saw the man crawl behind a clump
of bushes. In the natural course of events
the man should have appeared on the other side
of the clump. But he did nothing of the sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may be hiding there,” mused Tom.
“Perhaps waiting for a confederate. I’ll just
have a closer look at this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He advanced boldly toward the bushes.
There was nothing between him and the shrubbery,
and it was still light enough to see fairly
well. Besides, Tom had extraordinarily good
eyes. His astonishment can be imagined when,
on reaching the bush off which he had not taken
his gaze and behind which he had seen the
crawling man disappear he found—no one!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the queerest thing I’ve seen yet!”
exclaimed Tom, rubbing his organs of vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing beside the bush which came about
to his shoulders, Tom looked on all sides of it.
There was no hollow in the ground, as far as he
could make out, no depression and no other
clumps of shrubbery and no boulders behind
which a man might be hidden. Some distance
away there were all of these things in profusion,
for the land was wild and uncultivated outside
the plant fence. But there was not a hole,
boulder, or bush near enough to the one beside
which Tom stood to have enabled a man to
gain their protection while the young inventor
was watching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He just crawled back of his bush and then
vanished!” said Tom, in a half whisper to himself.
“If only I had a flashlight now——” He
was startled by hearing some one walking toward
him out of the darkness which was now quite
dense. “Here he comes!” thought Tom. “Appearing
as queerly as he disappeared. Or else
it’s one of his confederates.” He could see no
one, and his hand clutched something in his
pocket that might be used in case he was
attacked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a moment later, just as Tom’s nerves and
muscles were getting tense in anticipation of a
struggle, a cheery whistle broke out in the darkness,
mingling with the now louder sounds of
the footsteps, and Tom, with a cry of relief,
called:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you, Ned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, old scout!” was the reply. “Oh,
there you are!” went on Ned Newton, as he
caught sight of Tom at the same moment the
young inventor glimpsed his friend and financial
manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a bit late,” went on Ned. “I waited
for you, and when you didn’t show up I thought
I might as well walk in toward town and maybe
I’d meet you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I couldn’t get just what I wanted until
I had tried two or three places,” Tom answered.
“And then I met a man——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned broke into a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the idea?” Tom wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell that to Mary!” advised his chum.
“She may believe that and then you can tell
her another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” shrilly whistled Tom. “I forgot
all about Mary. I promised to call on her
to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure you did,” laughed Ned. “And I’ve
got a date with Helen. You said we’d go over
together and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clean forgot it!” broke in Tom. “And I
can’t go now. I’ve got something to do.”
Quickly he made up his mind to say nothing to
Ned of what he had seen until he investigated
a little on his own account. “Here, I tell you
what to do,” went on Tom. “Go on, keep your
date with Helen, but when you get to her house
telephone to Mary for me and say I’ll be a little
late. Will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pull your chestnuts out of the fire? Is that
it, Tom? I reminded you myself before supper!”
laughed Ned. “Well, I don’t mind, for
you’ve done the same for me. I guess Mary
Nestor knows you by this time, or, if she doesn’t,
she never will. But what’s the big idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ve just got a notion in my head,” said
Tom. “I want to go to the office a moment to
jot down some memoranda before I forget them.
’Phone Mary I’ll be over as soon as I can. See
you later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cheek!” exclaimed Ned, and with his merry
whistle he hurried off in the darkness. “I only
hope Mary speaks to you when you finally get
to see her,” floated back to Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you worry about Mary,” advised
the young inventor. “I’ll explain to her.
And tell her I’ll be along in about half an hour.
I really forgot all about the engagement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say you did!” playfully mocked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with his chum out of the way, Tom
gave himself to trying to solve the mystery.
For mystery he believed it to be. Seeing a man
step behind a bush and, on arriving at the bush,
to find nothing of the man there was surprising,
to say the least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sensing that it would soon be so dark that
it would be useless to investigate without an
illuminant of some sort, Tom made haste to
gain what advantage he could from the fast-fading
light. He looked sharply about without
moving from his place behind the bush on the
other side of which he had seen the man disappear.
Then, as he could pick up here no clew
to the strange happening, the young inventor
moved around to the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light was a little better here and Tom
saw something that made him fairly gasp with
astonishment. He had moved somewhat away
from the bush and almost at his feet was an
opening in the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This explains it!” murmured Tom, half
aloud. “A hole in the ground! He went down
there. I knew he couldn’t have dug himself in
as quickly as that. But that hole! I never
saw it before. It isn’t any of our doing. I’d
have known about it if it were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the land there belonged to Tom and his
father. It was a big field surrounding the
fenced-in plant, and often the smooth part of
the field was used as a landing place for aeroplanes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cautiously approaching the opening in the
ground and wondering more and more how it
had gotten there without his knowledge, Tom
saw that it had been closed by some planks
placed over it. These were now tossed to one
side, as if they had been hurriedly displaced.
Scattered about was loose earth which had
evidently covered the planks, thus hiding them
from the view of a casual observer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A secret opening!” murmured Tom. “This
is certainly the queerest thing I’ve ever seen!
What does it mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His surprise increased when, as he drew near
to the edge of the opening, he saw a rough flight
of plank steps going down into the hole. The
young man caught his breath sharply, it was so
astounding. But with Tom Swift to see and
think was to act, and a moment later he began
a descent of the steps into the mysterious hole.
It might have been the part of discretion to wait
until daylight, but a secret opening like this, so
near the Swift plant, could mean but one thing,
Tom reasoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one is trying to put up a game on us,”
he decided. “Unknown to us he has made a
tunnel under our plant. There’s something
funny here! I’m going to see what it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had fairly to feel his way down the
flight of plank steps. They were rough and
uneven, but solidly built. The young inventor
counted them as he descended so he would know
how to come back. Now that his head was
below the level of the ground it was so dark that
it was as if a velvet robe had been wrapped
about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He counted ten steps down, and was cautiously
feeling about with his right foot extended
to ascertain if there were any more, when suddenly
he felt the presence of some one near him.
He caught the sound of breath fiercely drawn in,
as if his unknown and unseen companion, there
in the darkness, was nerving himself for an
attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instinctively Tom drew back, his hands
pressed to the planked sides of the opening down
which he had descended. He could feel, rather
than see, some one leaning toward him. A
sweet, sickening odor came to his nostrils. He
felt a hand pressed over his face—a hand that
held a damp rag which gave off that overpowering
perfume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! What’s this? Who—who——” But
Tom Swift’s voice became a mere gurgle in his
throat. His legs became limp. His head
whirled and he seemed lifted up and carried
through measureless miles of space on the wings
of some great bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tom’s senses left him. He knew no
more.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>WAITING IN THE DARK</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Just how long Tom Swift remained unconscious
he himself did not know. It may
have been several hours, for when he came to
himself he felt a curious stiffness about his
muscles as if he had lain for some time on the
damp ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he was on the ground—a fact he ascertained
by feeling about with his hands, his
fingers encountering damp, packed earth and
the smooth surface of stones set in the soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where in the world am I, and what happened?”
thought Tom, as soon as he could
collect his senses enough to do any thinking.
“Gee, but I sure do feel queer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sickish taste in his mouth—a
sense of sweetness, such as he remembered followed
a slight operation he had undergone some
years before when an anæsthetic had been
given him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They doped me all right—that’s what they
did,” mused Tom. “Ether, chloroform, or
something like that. It knocked me out. But
I’m beginning to feel all right again—no headache
or anything like that. But what does it all
mean, and where am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those were questions not easily answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Tom Swift is trying to collect his senses
and to remember, in their sequence, the events
which led up to his queer predicament, may I
take just a moment of your time, if you are a
new reader, to tell you who Tom was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first book of this series, “Tom Swift and
His Motor Cycle,” introduces you to the young
inventor. His father, Barton Swift, was a
widower, living in the old homestead at Shopton
on Lake Carlopa. The Swift home was on
the outskirts of the town and in a building not
far from the house Barton Swift began work on
a series of inventions which were destined to
make him and his son famous. Tom’s mother
was dead, but Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper,
looked well after the material welfare of Tom
and his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In due time Tom began to follow in his
father’s footsteps, working at small inventions
until, when a sturdy youth, he became
possessed of a motorcycle. He bought the
machine of an eccentric individual named Wakefield
Damon, who lived in the neighboring town
of Waterfield. Mr. Damon set out to learn to
ride his new machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But bless my porous plaster!” the queer
man would exclaim in telling the story, “I never
thought the contraption was going to climb
trees!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which it did, or tried to, because Mr. Damon
did not know how to manage it. The result was
that the rider was injured and the motorcycle
badly smashed and Tom, near whose home the
accident occurred, became the owner of the
machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How he repaired it, added some improvements,
and what he did with the machine are fully set
forth in the book. It was the beginning of a
long friendship with Mr. Damon, and also the
real start of Tom’s inventive career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those of you who have followed him in his
successes, from his motor boat to “Tom Swift’s
Chest of Secrets,”—the volume immediately
preceding this one—need not be told of Tom’s
activities. He had made some wonderful pieces
of apparatus and had had some startling adventures.
In some of these his father and Mr.
Damon had shared. So, also, had Ned Newton,
Tom’s closest friend and now the treasurer of
the Swift Construction Company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary Nestor, of whom Ned had spoken, was
a beautiful girl whom Tom hoped to marry
some day, and Ned Newton was interested
in a similar manner in Mary’s friend, Helen
Morton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tom sat there in the darkness, trying to
puzzle out where he was and how he had gotten
there, his thought flashed to Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what she’ll think?” he mused.
“I’d better get to a telephone and explain.
Let’s see. I was coming back from town and
I saw some fellow sneaking along behind the
bushes. I met Ned. I went down a flight of
stairs in a hole—though how they could be there
and I not know it, is more than I can fathom.
Then they doped me. But who did it and
why, I don’t know. I’ll soon find out, though.
Wonder how long I’ve been here? Feels like
a week, I’m so stiff. But I’m not hurt, thank
goodness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom stretched out his arms in the darkness.
They responded to the action of his muscles.
But when he tried to get up and walk—well, he
simply could not!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chained fast!” cried Tom, aloud. His
hands had sought his left ankle when he found
that something held him fast there, and his
fingers had come in contact with a chain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he felt a sinking sensation.
To be chained fast in the dark, at the bottom
of some cave or dungeon, located he knew not
where, was enough to take the heart out of
any one. But not for long did Tom Swift give
way to despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a vigorous tug to the chain about his
ankle. After all, it might only be lying across
it or loosely twisted. But it needed only one
effort on his part to loosen the links to let him
know that he was bound fast. Whoever had
put the chain on his ankle had done so with
serious intentions of holding the young inventor
captive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this is worse and more of it!” he mused
grimly. “What does it all mean? It can’t be
a plot to kidnap me. No one knew I was coming
across the lots, for I didn’t know it myself
until the last minute. And seeing that man
sneaking along, discovering the secret stairs—it
was all a series of accidents. Though it’s
likely to prove a serious accident for me if I
can’t get loose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was nothing if not practical, and first he
felt about with his hands to determine the exact
nature of what it was that held him fast. He
discovered, by the sense of touch, that something
in the nature of a handcuff was snapped
about his ankle. To this cuff, or leg-iron, was
attached a chain. By following this, link by
link, Tom found that the chain was made fast
to a ring of iron which, in turn, was sunk into
the stone side wall of the cave or tunnel in
which he now found himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How far he was removed from the bottom of
the flight of secret steps where he had been
made unconscious, he did not know, any more
than he knew where he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having discovered what it was that held him
fast and the nature of the chain and its fastenings,
Tom, who had risen to his feet, stood silent
a moment, listening. It was very black and
very still in the cave, if such it was, and from
the earthy, damp smell he concluded that he
must be underground, or at least in some vault
or cellar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By test Tom found that he could move about
five feet, such being the length of the chain.
The leg-iron had been snapped or riveted about
his ankle outside of his trousers. It was not
tight enough to cause any pain, but it was snug
enough to be impossible of removal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got me as tight as an animal in a
trap!” grimly exclaimed the youth, when, by a
series of tugs, he ascertained how securely the
end of the chain was fast in the rocky wall.
“Just like a trap, or a prisoner in an old-time
dungeon!” bitterly reflected the young man.
“All it needs to make a moving picture film is
some beautiful maiden to come to my rescue
with a file——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom’s spoken words (for he was talking aloud
to himself) came to a sudden end as he clapped
a hand to the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got ’em!” he fairly shouted, and he drew
out a small paper parcel in which were two keen
files. They were part of the purchases made
just before stumbling on the mysterious man
and finding the steps in the queer opening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Files—the hardest and best made!” he told
himself. “They’ll cut through anything but a
diamond. Luck’s with me, after all. They
didn’t know I had these! Oh, boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything seemed changed now! Though
he was held fast, though he was in some secret
dungeon, hope sang a song of joy in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Tom debated with himself as
to the best end of the chain at which to begin
filing. It would be more comfortable with
that leg-iron off his ankle, but by feeling it in
the darkness he could tell that it was broad and
thick. It would take some time for even the
keen, hard file to cut through it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll file through one of the links close to the
leg-iron,” decided Tom. “That won’t leave
much to carry around, and it won’t take long to
cut through a link—that is, unless they’re made
of case-hardened steel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the chain was of the ordinary sort, made
of soft iron, and it did not take the young
inventor long, practiced as he was in the use of
tools, to file apart one of the links. True it
was not easy in the darkness, and, more than
once, the file slipped and cut Tom’s hands or
fingers, for he changed from left to right and
back to left in using the file, having taught himself
to be ambidextrous in many operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he could feel that the link was nearly
severed and then, inserting the small ends of the
two files in it, he pried them apart. This
leverage broke the thin remaining bit of iron
and Tom was free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is, he was free to move about as he
pleased, but he was still within the dark cave,
and where it was he could not imagine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to feel my way about,” he told himself.
“It’s as dark as the inside of a pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So dark was it that Tom had to tread cautiously
and with outstretched hands lest he
bump into some obstruction. Whether he was
moving toward the steps down which he had
come or in the opposite direction, Tom had no
means of knowing. His sense of touch alone
guided him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could feel that he was walking along a
tunnel, but the size of it he could only guess at.
Then, suddenly, on making an elbow turn, he
saw, glimmering in the distance, a faint light.
It was the light of day, Tom knew, and by that
he realized that he had been held captive all
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That makes it bad,” he mused. “Dad will
have done a lot of worrying about me, I’m
afraid. But I guess I’ll soon be out of here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, to his ears, came the murmur of voices—voices
strange to him. So faint was the light
in the distance that it was of no service to him
where he stood waiting in the darkness; waiting
for he knew not what.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voices increased in loudness, showing that
the speakers were approaching. Then he heard
footsteps echoing strangely in the hollow tunnel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there’s going to be a fight I’d better get
ready for it,” Tom told himself fiercely. He
stooped and began feeling about on the ground
for a loose rock or a club. But he could find
nothing. Then like a flash it came to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the files! They’re pretty sharp on
the handle end. As good as a knife! I’ll use it
like a knife if I have to,” he mused desperately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew one of the files from his pocket,
grasped it firmly, and waited in the darkness
for what was to happen next.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MASKED MEN</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>After the treatment that had been accorded
him, Tom Swift rather welcomed than otherwise
a chance to come to grips with the men
who were responsible for his position. Usually
even-tempered and generous, just now he felt
eager for vengeance and he would not have
cared much if two men had attacked him at
once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strangely enough he did not feel weak or ill
now. He had, somewhat, when he first regained
his senses after having been overpowered by
some drug. But his brain had cleared and he
kept himself in such good physical trim all the
while that even a night of unconsciousness had
not sapped his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light in the distance did not increase
any, from which Tom gathered that it was full
daylight with the sun well above the horizon,
and after that first murmur of voices and the
sound of footsteps these sounds did not come
any nearer. Nor did Tom catch a glimpse
of any figures between himself and that little
circle of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then from some point outside the cave or
tunnel he heard voices calling. They were
louder than the first, and there seemed to be
some dispute or disturbance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voices rose to a high pitch and then died
away. Silence followed, and then came the
sound of retreating footsteps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re going away!” exulted Tom. “Now
I’ve got a chance to walk toward that daylight
and see where I am. Maybe I’d better wait a
few minutes, though. They may come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited what he thought was several
minutes and then, hearing no other sounds of
voices or footsteps, began a cautious approach
toward that gleam of light. What a blessed
thing light was, after all that black and clinging
darkness!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In silence Tom crept on, advancing one foot
after the other cautiously, and keeping one
hand extended to give warning of his approach
toward any obstruction while in his other hand
he held the file like a dagger, ready to use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no occasion for this. A little
later he found himself standing in a circle of
daylight illumination that filtered down an
inclined shaft which led out of a tunnel, such as
Tom could now ascertain he was in. A natural
tunnel it appeared to be, with rocks jutting out
here and there in the earthen sides. Roughly
the tunnel was in the form of a half circle, the
floor being flat and the roof arched. The
inclined entrance led upward in a gentle slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now to see what’s up there!” said
Tom to himself, taking a long breath and holding
his weapon ready. He tensed his muscles
and steeled his nerves for what he felt might be
a desperate struggle. Yet he did not shrink
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he advanced cautiously, step by step, up
the incline that led to daylight and the outer
world, he felt at first a sense of disappointment
when he saw no one with whom he might come
to grips. He had been treated so meanly that
it would have been a source of satisfaction to
have had it out in a rough-and-tumble fight with
those responsible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, to his surprise, Tom pushed his way out
through a tangle of underbrush and bushes which
grew about this end of the tunnel and found none
to dispute him. This surprise was added to when
he looked about him and found out where he
was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On Barn Door Island!” exclaimed Tom.
“Of all places! Barn Door Island! But how
did I get here? It’s miles away from where I
went down those steps near our plant. Of all
places! Barn Door Island!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a small island in Lake Carlopa which
had been named Barn Door because, some
time or other, one of the early settlers happened
to remark that it was no larger than the door of
a barn. The island was at the end of the lake
farthest removed from Shopton and the Swift
plant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never knew there was an entrance to a
tunnel here!” said Tom, as he looked about him.
“But then I’ve never explored here very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor had any of the other lads of Shopton.
Barn Door Island was a barren place—merely a
collection of scrubby trees and tangled bushes
and great boulders set down at the swampy end
of Lake Carlopa. It was not a good fishing
location and too dreary for picnic parties, so
Barn Door was seldom visited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if I had an idea there was a tunnel
entrance here—the beginning of a passage that
led under the lake and under the land right up
to our place I’d have done a lot of exploring,
that’s sure!” Tom told himself. “That’s a
natural tunnel, I’m positive of it, at least most
of it is. Somebody went along it until they got
to the end near our fence. Then they broke
out, put in those steps and made the plank
covering for the opening. They put earth over
the planks so no one would see them. That part
must have been done recently, for we were trying
airships out in that field a month ago and
I landed right near that bush behind which
the man disappeared. I know I did, for I remember
thinking I might crash into the fence.
So the land end of this queer tunnel has only
been opened lately. This island end must have
been here a long while. But it’s queer no one
knew of it. And I wonder what it’s being used
for? Something to do with our business, I’m
sure. Our enemies are at work again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom quickly reviewed the situation in his
mind. Since his Chest of Secrets had been
taken and he had had so much trouble in recovering
it, he had been very cautious about his
plans of new inventions. Suspecting several
of his newer employes, he had gotten rid of them
and had taken great precautions, on the advice
of Ned and his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if there’s a tunnel from this lonely island
under the lake and beneath the shore right up
almost to our plant, it means that something
desperate is in the wind,” reasoned Tom.
“They must have resented my blundering into
it as I did, and they tried to put me out of the
way. After they doped me they must have
carried me a long way through the tunnel, to
chain me fast near this end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m free now, and out in the open.
About noon, I should judge by the sun and by
the way my stomach feels,” Tom went on, with
a grim smile, for he was getting hungry and
feeling a bit weak now. “I hope it isn’t more
than the next day,” he went on, meaning the
day following his night encounter with Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked about him. Barn Door Island was
about five acres in extent, large enough, on account
of its wild character, to give concealment
to any number of enemies. But if there were
any such here now they did not show themselves
as Tom eagerly and anxiously scanned
the somewhat wild landscape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now that I know where I am, though
I can’t understand how or why I was put in that
tunnel and chained,” mused the lad, as he looked
at the iron still on his leg, “I might as well try
to get back home. It’s pretty lonesome down
here, and I don’t know whether I can signal
any one or not. But it isn’t far to the mainland
and I can swim it. Though if I’m going to do
that I’d better file this iron off. No fun swimming
with that bracelet on my ankle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked about for a place where he could
sit down and file in comfort at the remaining
evidence of his recent bondage when, as he approached
the shore, he saw, pulled up close to
a rude dock in a little cove, a small motor boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if this isn’t luck!” cried Tom. “There
must be some picnic party here and that’s their
boat. But no—wait a minute! Maybe it
belongs to those men I heard talking in the
tunnel. I’ll wager that’s it. And this is my
chance! I’ll appropriate their boat since they
treated me like a roughneck. I’ll get back
home, maybe in time to stop their trick—whatever
it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not much about a motor boat that
Tom Swift did not know, and it took him but a
few seconds to ascertain that this one was in
good working order. No longer considering the
need of filing off the leg-iron, Tom pushed the
boat out from the dock, which was merely a few
old logs and planks, and prepared to start the
engine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned the flywheel and, almost at the
first revolution after he had thrown the spark
switch, the engine was in motion. But even as
it glided out of the little cove Tom was aware
of the presence of another craft. Around one of
the points of the cove, as he guided his boat out,
the other swung in, and a glance showed it to be
occupied by four rough-looking men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two of them wore masks. The faces of the
other two were familiar to Tom, for they were
two of his recently discharged workmen—Kenny
and Schlump!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had a feeling that some desperate work
was in prospect. The attack on him, the rendering
of him unconscious, his being chained
fast—all this was more than accidental coincidence
following his trailing of the man who
had disappeared down in the tunnel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment those in the second boat remained
gazing, spellbound, it seemed, at Tom,
who was rapidly putting distance between
himself and those he felt were his enemies.
The boat he had so unexpectedly found proved
to be a speedy little craft. But the other was
also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Tom Swift now!” cried Schlump,
pointing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?” asked one of the masked men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In our boat!” Schlump answered. “Come
back here!” he roared, shaking his fist at Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back nothing!” taunted the young
inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t stop to talk!” shouted one of the
masked men. “Speed up! We must catch
Swift at any cost!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch4'>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A NIGHT OF WORRY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>About nine o’clock on the night when Tom
Swift had witnessed the strange actions of the
man who so mysteriously disappeared, the telephone
bell tinkled in the Swift home. As Tom’s
father was reading a scientific book in which he
was much engrossed, Mrs. Baggert went to the
instrument. Half-interested in the conversation,
Mr. Swift listened to the one-sided talk,
hearing Mrs. Baggert say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how do you do, Miss Nestor? No, Tom
isn’t here. I haven’t seen him since supper.
His father is here. Do you want to speak to
him? What’s that? Oh, all right. Yes, I’ll
be sure to tell him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t Tom over at Mary’s house?” asked
the aged inventor, with a shade of anxiety in his
voice as he looked up from his book. He had
guessed at what he had not heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he isn’t there, and Miss Nestor is getting
tired of waiting, I guess,” answered the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Tom?” asked his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Mrs. Baggert replied. “He
started for Shopton right after supper, saying
he had to buy some things at the hardware
store before it closed. I heard Mr. Ned tell
him not to be late and Tom promised he
wouldn’t. I didn’t know then what Mr. Ned
warned him not to be late for, but I can guess
now that it was in calling on Miss Nestor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he hasn’t arrived there yet,” murmured
Mr. Swift. “That’s a bit odd, for Tom doesn’t
usually break his engagements—especially with
Mary Nestor,” and he smiled a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Miss Nestor told me to say to you that
she wasn’t in the least worried,” Mrs. Baggert
made haste to add. “She says she knows Tom
is very busy and something may have come up
at the last moment. She says he promised to
take her to see a moving picture this evening.
She has been waiting some time, and she called
up to say if he couldn’t come it would be all
right, and she would go to the second show with
her mother. That’s all the message was about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, I guess it’s all right then,” returned
Mr. Swift, with an air of relief. “Tom is probably
delayed in Shopton, getting what he
wanted. But he should have telephoned, either
here or to Mary. It isn’t fair to keep a young
lady waiting like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Nestor said to be sure and tell him she
wasn’t at all put out because he didn’t come,”
said Mrs. Baggert. “She knows it must be
some good reason that kept him away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope it is,” said Mr. Swift. “But it isn’t
like Tom to stay away without sending some
word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the hours passed and the young inventor
neither returned nor communicated, the anxiety
in his father’s mind grew, until, about midnight
when the front door was heard to open,
Mr. Swift cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that you, Tom? Where have you been?
Why didn’t you send some word? And you
have broken your promise to call on Mary!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t Tom,” came in the voice of Ned
Newton, who, of late, had been living at the
Swift home. “But you don’t mean to tell me
Tom isn’t here! I was just going to tell him he
was in for a bad half hour the next time he
called on Mary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Ned, Tom isn’t here,” said Mr. Swift,
who had sat up past his usual retiring hour to
meet his son when he should arrive. “And he
isn’t over at Mary’s house, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know he isn’t there,” Ned said. “Helen
and I stopped in on our way back from the
pictures to find out why we hadn’t seen those
two at the show. We found Mary a bit disturbed
because Tom had neither called nor
telephoned. That’s why I was going to tell him
he was in for a bad time when next he sees
Mary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he isn’t here,” said Mr. Swift. “I
can’t understand it. He went over to Shopton
directly after supper, Mrs. Baggert says, and he
hasn’t returned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, he came back,” Ned replied quickly.
“I saw him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?” cried the aged inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just outside the big fence—on the landing
field, in fact. Tom was on his way here then.
He found what he wanted in some Shopton
store, he told me, and I said he’d better hurry
if he was going to keep his date with Mary. I
was a bit late myself, so I left him and hurried
on and he started for the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then something has happened to him, for
he never got here!” exclaimed Mr. Swift.
“Something has happened!” He was getting
excited and Ned did not like that, for the aged
man’s health was far from good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not necessarily,” said Ned, in easier
tones than his own feelings justified. “Tom’s
all right, you can be sure of that. He knows
how to take care of himself. Besides, how
could anything happen at his own doorstep, so
to speak? He was near the big fence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m sure something has happened,”
Mr. Swift declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ned shook his head and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More than likely,” he said, “Tom went into
his private office to leave what he had bought
in Shopton. Once he was at his desk he saw
something he had forgotten to do, or he was
taken with a sudden idea, and he sat down to
make some note about it before it slipped out
of his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t the first time he has done that, nor
the first time he has made dates with Mary
and then forgotten all about them. Don’t
worry, Mr. Swift, you’ll find Tom in his private
office over at the works.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is easily settled,” was the answer.
“I’ll call him on the telephone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an instrument in the living room
where this conversation took place. The Swift
home and works were linked by intercommunicating
telephones, and Mr. Swift was soon
plugging in on the circuit that connected with
Tom’s private office. While he was waiting
Mrs. Baggert came quietly into the room behind
Mr. Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Tom home?” she asked of Ned, forming
the words with her lips but not speaking, since
she did not want to disturb Mr. Swift. Ned
shook his head in negation, and a puzzled look
spread over the face of the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re too easily worried,” mused Ned,
half-smiling. “Tom is all right, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this certainty gradually disappeared
when several seconds went by and there was no
answer to the bell that must be ringing in Tom’s
office at the works.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he there?” Ned could not help asking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t seem to be,” Mr. Swift replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he’s on his way home,” Ned was
saying when Mr. Swift suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one is at the ’phone now! Oh, hello,
Koku!” he called into the transmitter. “Yes,
I am here. But where’s Tom? Is he there?
What? He isn’t? Has he been there? No!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silence on Mr. Swift’s part, following his
last word, told Ned and Mrs. Baggert, more
than anything else, how worried he was. He
appeared to be listening to what the giant at the
other end of the wire was saying. Then he
spoke again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be right over, Koku. Yes, I’m coming
and so is Mr. Newton. Don’t bring Eradicate?
Well, he might be of some help. There’s
no use in you being jealous. Look around
until we get there. Tom may be in some of the
other buildings!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly Mr. Swift replaced the receiver on
the hook and then, turning to Ned and the
housekeeper, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom isn’t there and hasn’t been since he
left early in the afternoon. Koku has just
made his rounds and hasn’t seen him, but I
told him to go over the place again and have
the other watchmen go with him. We’ll go
ourselves and help search. I’m sure something
has happened to Tom!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch5'>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A CRASH</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Adventures in plenty had befallen Tom
Swift, and in many of them Ned Newton had
had a share. But always the young inventor
had come out “on top of the heap,” so perhaps
Ned was justified in his feeling that everything
would be all right. Still he could understand
and appreciate Mr. Swift’s worry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Swift began looking for his hat and neck
scarf, this last on the suggestion of his housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later Mr. Swift, Ned, and Eradicate,
the aged colored servant who had been in the
Swift family many years, were on their way to
the big plant, almost a mile distant. Ned had
brought around to the door one of the small
cars Tom used to make trips between his home
and the shop, and it did not take long to reach
the main gate in the big fence surrounding the
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So many and varied had been the attempts to
rob Tom of the fruits of his and his father’s
brains that drastic measures to guard the place
had been put into effect. The big fence, impossible
to scale without long ladders, was one
protection. In addition there were burglar
alarm wires along the fence, which wires would
give warning of any attempt to get under it or
over it. In addition there was a strip of metal,
charged with a high-power current which could
be turned on at will, and this would give
unauthorized trespassers a severe shock. It
would not kill, but would disable for a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition there were other forms of protection,
and so well guarded were the different
gates, by night and day, that not even Tom himself
could get in without due formality. So it
was when the party of searchers arrived, they
were not at once let in. The guard at the gate
must first be certain who he was admitting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good lan’!” exclaimed Eradicate. “Dish
is plum’ foolishness! Cain’t yo’ look an’ see
dat ole Massa Swift hisse’f am heah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have to be cautious, Rad,” said
Ned, as he got out of the machine to give the
password which was used each night. He saw
Koku, the giant, coming down the path inside
the fence, and the big man at once recognized
the visitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between Eradicate and Koku there was
rivalry and jealousy because each one wanted
to serve Tom without having the other called on.
And no sooner had the colored man caught sight
of the giant, as the latter told the watchman to
open the gate, than Eradicate burst out with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hu! Dat’s jest laik de big ninny! Don’t
know his own folks! It’s a wonder to me dat
Massa Tom keep him, he’s so dumb!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Black man talk much—not do anything!”
growled the giant. “Look out or um be
squashed,” and he opened and closed his
enormous hands as if he wanted to clutch the
old servant in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do now, you two!” warned Mr.
Swift. “We came to find Tom. Are you sure
he isn’t here, Koku?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not too sure, master; Not sure much
about Master Tom—he go—he come—no can
tell—no can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s about right,” agreed Ned, with a
laugh. “Tom certainly goes and comes without
telling any one much about it. But I
gathered, from what he said to me just outside
the fence, that he would be right along. There
didn’t seem to be anything special he had to
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just where was it you met him?” asked
Mr. Swift. “Let us start the investigation
from there, you and I, Ned. Meanwhile, I will
have all the other shops called by telephone
from the central here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave orders to this effect to one of the
watchmen and then with Ned went to the
place, outside the fence, where Tom had last
talked with his chum. But it was dark, and
Ned, naturally, could not point out the exact
spot, even with the aid of a flashlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it was here, near this rock and bush,”
he said, throwing the gleam of his little electric
torch about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the dry, hard ground gave no clews to
this superficial examination, and, as a matter
of fact, Ned was about twenty-five feet off in his
calculations, as was demonstrated later. Otherwise
he and Mr. Swift might have seen the hole
in the ground and the flight of stairs, for it was
not until some time later that night—near
morning, as a matter of fact—that the plotters
replaced the planks and spread earth over them,
thus hiding the secret entrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there doesn’t seem to be anything
here,” said Mr. Swift, with an uneasy sigh as
they made a hasty examination of the place.
“We had better go inside and look there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the search in and about the many buildings
of the great Swift plant was no more successful.
Every office and shop telephone had
been rung. Some were answered by guards
or watchmen who happened to be in the vicinity
at the time the bell rang. But one and all said
they had not seen Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was a check-up of every gate and
entrance in the big fence, and at no place had
Tom been admitted. Granting that his protective
plans worked, he could not have entered
his own plant without a record having been
made of it, and there was none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s only one answer to this, then,”
said Ned, when the search had ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the answer?” asked Mr. Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom didn’t come in here after he left me.
He must have gone somewhere else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Swift looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suppose he could be at Mary’s
now?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What time is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he wouldn’t be there at this hour!”
declared Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He might,” replied Mr. Swift hopefully.
“When Tom’s mind is busy on his inventions
he forgets all about time. It would be just like
him to forget that it was three o’clock in the
morning and go to call on Mary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned shook his head, but Mr. Swift went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to call her presently. But there
is just one more place I want to search. It’s in
the vault where we keep the Chest of Secrets,
as Tom calls it. There is a private entrance to
that he could come in by and not register the
alarm nor be seen by any of the guards. He
can switch off that alarm from his room at the
house. I’ll look there. He may have gone
there to see if there isn’t some way out in the
trouble we’re in over the airline express patents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trouble?” questioned Ned, as they walked
toward the vault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Tom and I haven’t spoken of it even
to you, Ned, for the thing really isn’t in such
shape that it can be talked about. But Tom
has an idea, it may be nothing more than a
dream, that he can establish a line of travel to
cross our continent from New York to San
Francisco between dawn and darkness. In
other words, a coast-to-coast service, from ocean
to ocean, by daylight—say sixteen hours—with
no change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No change!” cried Ned. “What’s the idea—refueling
the planes in the air? Of course
that has been done. But from coast to coast
in sixteen hours without change! It can’t be
done!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom thinks so,” said Mr. Swift. “That’s
what he’s working on now. He has had some
new models made, but there is trouble over the
patent rights. Some one is trying to get his
idea away from him. It may be that Tom came
to the secret vault after he left you to make
sure everything was all right, and he may be
there yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the vault was unoccupied, nor had it been
disturbed. Mr. Swift gave a hasty glance at
several complicated and odd-looking models of
aircraft in the concrete room, looked over a
pile of papers, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they haven’t been disturbed since
Tom and I were here last, which proves my
son hasn’t been here. But where is he? I’m
beginning to get worried, Ned. More worried
than ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’ll be all right,” was the answer,
though in his own heart Ned Newton could not
help feeling apprehensive. “It may be, as you
say, that he made a very late call on Mary, and
her folks have probably asked him to stay all
night, as they have done before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think the matter justifies me in calling
Mr. Nestor on the telephone,” said Mr. Swift,
as they emerged from the vault where the Chest
of Secrets was stored. “It’s rather early to ring
up anybody, but I guess they will understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about four o’clock now, and already,
in the east, a light was appearing, the sun was
heralding the dawn. The early birds were
beginning to sing. It would soon be morning,
though not yet time for the wheels to begin
humming in the Swift plant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going back to the office, where Koku reported
that a second check-up had failed to disclose
the whereabouts of the young inventor,
Mr. Swift called the Shopton central operator
and gave her the number of the Nestor house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was some little delay, as was natural
when a call is made at that hour of the morning,
but at length Mr. Nestor’s voice was heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who? Tom? No, he isn’t here—hasn’t
been here,” was the message the aged inventor
received. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was some further talk, and Mr. Swift
briefly outlined what had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t alarm Mary yet,” Mr. Swift cautioned
his friend. “But I fear something has happened
to Tom. I wish you would come over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will!” Mr. Nestor promised. “I’ll be
over as soon as I can dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him I’ll call for him,” Ned said to Mr.
Swift, and this message went over the wires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was fully light when they went down into
the yard where the small auto had been left.
And suddenly the silence of the dawn, made
musical by the twitterings of the birds, was
broken by an increasing roar and throbbing
noise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Airship!” grunted Koku.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suah enough!” exclaimed Eradicate, pointing
up. “Dere she am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The throbbing sound became louder, and a
moment later they saw the plane, a large one,
approaching from the west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Mr. Damon’s machine!” cried Ned.
“What in the world is he flying so early for?
He isn’t sure enough of himself to take that big
plane out alone—he only got it the other day.
Great Scott! Look! He’s going to hit your
mooring mast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one end of the big landing field outside the
fence Tom had recently erected a tall steel mast,
to which he moored a small dirigible balloon
with which he was conducting experiments. As
all looked up they saw Mr. Damon in his new
machine headed straight for this mast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t know it’s there!” cried Ned.
“He’s sure going to hit!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later there was an alarming crash,
and the top of the mast was seen to break off
while one edge of the aeroplane’s left wing
crumpled.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch6'>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>AGAIN A PRISONER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The threat which Tom Swift heard the men
in the pursuing motor boat mutter—a threat
to catch him at any cost—was not needed to
cause him to speed up the craft he had appropriated
in an endeavor to escape. The sinister
character of the men who wore the masks he
could easily guess at. As to the others, he had
begun to suspect them soon after they obtained
work in his plant. Though they were clever
mechanics, Tom did not like Kenny and
Schlump and so had directed their discharge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They either have it in for me on that account,”
mused Tom, as he made an adjustment
to the motor to get more speed, “or else there’s
something deeper in the plot. I guess they
must have chained me up after I blundered
into their tunnel. I’d like to know what all
this means, but now is not the time to stop
and find out. I must get away and ask questions
afterward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to be a desperate chase—Tom Swift
realized that from the tense and eager manner
of the men in the boat now plowing through the
waters of Lake Carlopa. They were forcing
their craft to her best speed in an endeavor to
overtake him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a wonder they don’t begin shooting,”
mused Tom. “A crowd of men like that, with
two of them masked, won’t stop at shooting.
Maybe I’d better get down a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been standing up in the boat, the
better to make adjustments to the motor, but
now, as he thought of the possibility of being
fired upon, he crouched down to give less of a
target to the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This move of his seemed to be misinterpreted
by the pursuers, for one of them cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There he goes overboard! One of you take
after him!” This was shouted by one of the
masked men, whose identity Tom Swift could
only guess at, though he judged all of them to be
some of his enemies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the young inventor had no intention of
jumping out of the boat to swim for safety. He
knew he would soon be overtaken and captured.
His only chance lay in beating the scoundrels
in a race. Besides, he was in no physical condition
to endure a long swim. He had been
in a most uncomfortable, cramped position
all night, and the exertion of filing off the chain
and going through the tunnel to emerge on
Barn Door Island had tired him. He had had
no breakfast, and this lack was now beginning
to make itself felt more than at first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he crouched down in the boat, where
only a small part of his body showed above the
rail, he remembered that he had in his pocket
some chocolate candy. He had bought it the
night before on his trip to town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll make a breakfast on that,” mused Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So as he crouched there in the boat he reached
into his pocket, got out the cake of chocolate,
and began to nibble it. In a few minutes he
felt decidedly better. That “gone” feeling
had left his stomach, and he began to relish,
rather than fear, the outcome of the impending
struggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pursuit had started at the end of the lake
where there was no town or other settlement,
but at the pace it would not be more than half
an hour before he would sight his home town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few moments after the wild chase began
Tom could hear the men in the other boat shouting
after him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back here! Stop that boat! It’s
ours! Stop or we’ll shoot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead and shoot!” taunted Tom, hardly
believing, after this delay, that they would go
to this extreme. And they did not. Evidently
their plan was to capture him alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was so anxious to know whether or not
his craft was keeping a sufficient distance in
front of the other boat that he did not pay much
attention to the course he was steering. The
result was that, after he had swung out around
a small island he was almost run down by a tug
boat hauling some coal barges from one side of
Lake Carlopa to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom just had time to give the wheel a quick
turn, and he fairly grazed one of the coal barges.
This brought angry shouts from the captain of
the tug who demanded to know:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in the name of thunderation are
you trying to do, anyhow? Get yourself sunk?
You soft-soaping landlubber, look where you’re
going!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom did not reply. He had half a notion
to swing about, run up alongside the tug and
appeal for help. Then a wild desire came into
his mind to beat these men alone and single-handed
if he could. It would be sportier that
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for his pursuers, when they saw the tug
and barges they appeared to hesitate a moment,
as if ready to give up the chase. But when they
saw Tom keep on, they did the same, still chasing
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For perhaps ten minutes more the chase was
kept up. Tom could make out, by hasty observations
over his stern, that three of the
men were in consultation while the fourth one
steered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There now loomed up in front of Tom another
island—a larger one than Barn Door, and he
recognized it as the last one in this end of the
lake before he could swing into the wider part
of the water through which there was a straight
course to Shopton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once I get past there,” said Tom to himself,
“I’m safe. They won’t dare chase me after
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he neared the island he noticed that his
motor was behaving in a peculiar manner.
Every now and then it would miss an explosion.
Then it would cough and wheeze a bit, after
which it would go on again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, old girl?” asked Tom,
for to him machinery was almost something
alive and he talked to it as he would to a human
being. “Are you getting tired?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked over the working parts. They
seemed to be all right. But again came a miss—then
several of them. And finally, with a last
cough and wheeze, the motor stopped altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more gas!” exclaimed Tom. Well he
knew that last wheeze when there is nothing
more for the carburetor to feed on. He had
used up the last drop of gasoline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess I’m done for,” mused Tom. “They
must have known there wasn’t enough gas in
the tank to carry me far. That’s why they
kept on.” He looked back. The pursuers
were perhaps five hundred feet astern, and
Tom’s boat was so close to the island that he
knew, with the headway still on, he could reach
the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned the prow toward the little cove and
as soon as he was near enough he leaped over
the bow, landing on the rocky shore, and ran up
into the fastness of the island, which was covered
with scrubby trees and bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked about for a good place where he
might conceal himself. He was sensible enough
to know that to try to fight four men was taking
on odds that were too heavy. He saw a little
recess in the rocks, and squeezed into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later he heard the voices of the
men as they steered their boat up against the
one he had deserted. Then he heard them
jumping out on the gravelly beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got him now!” one remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can’t get away,” added another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless he swims for it—we’ve got both
boats!” said a third.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t try swimming—we could easily
overtake him in our boat,” declared the fourth
scoundrel, and Tom sensed that this was true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scatter now, and find him!” one of the men
ordered, and the hiding youth could hear them
crashing about in the bushes looking for him.
It was a foregone conclusion that they would
find him sooner or later. Tom had not had
time to look for a good hiding place, being
under the necessity of taking the first one that
offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was no wonder that, a few minutes after
he had landed on the island, he heard some one
coming nearer and nearer. He tried to force
himself farther into the crevice of the rocks,
but it was no use. His movements dislodged
some small stones which fell with a rattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here he is!” cried a voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next moment Tom was looking into the
leering face of Kenny, and then along came
Schlump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter held a revolver, and even without
this weapon Tom would have been forced to
submit, for the two masked men soon came to
the aid of their companions. Tom felt that
discretion was the better part of valor in this
instance. Besides, he hoped, by submitting
quietly now, to escape by strategy a little later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he thought he would try a little bluff and
bluster first, so he addressed the men with
righteous indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fellows have nerve!” he exclaimed.
“What do you mean by treating me this way?
I’ll have you all arrested for this and sent up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Like you did Barsky, I suppose,”
sneered one of the masked men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom started at the mention of that name.
Barsky or Blodgett, for he used both names, had
been concerned in the theft of Tom’s Chest of
Secrets. Barsky had been arrested, together
with Renwick Fawn, and had been sent to jail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But maybe they have escaped,” thought
Tom. “Maybe these two men are Fawn and
Barsky.” He closely observed the actions of
the men, but neither of them threw out his
elbow in a jerky manner, which had been a
characteristic of Fawn, nor were any of Barsky’s
peculiarities observable in the other masked
individual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut out the talk,” advised Kenny to the
man who had mentioned Barsky’s name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want of me?” boldly demanded
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll find out soon enough,” answered
Schlump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his intention of keeping secret the reason
for their bold acts was not shared by the masked
man who had spoken of the imprisoned Barsky.
For approaching Tom and shaking his fist in
the lad’s face the scoundrel exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re trying to beat us out of our invention,
but it can’t be done! We’ve got you
now where we want you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your invention—what do you mean?”
asked Tom, genuinely puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The airline express car,” was the unexpected
answer. “That’s our invention, and we’re going
to get patents on it ahead of you! We don’t
intend to let you cheat us out of it. You stole
our ideas and models, but we’ll use your models
if we have to and get the patents that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be crazy!” exploded Tom.
“Your invention! You don’t know what you’re
talking about! That car is my own and my
father’s idea! As soon as I get away from here
I’ll make you sweat for what you’ve done to
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the men laughed in a sinister manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be a long while before you get away
from here!” he boasted. “You’ll stay a prisoner
even if we have to ship you to the South Seas!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch7'>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE PLOT</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Closing in on Tom, the four men soon had
him securely bound with ropes. He felt there
was little use in struggling against such overwhelming
odds. He must conserve his strength
until he could use it to better advantage. For
the young inventor did not intend to remain
any longer than he could help a prisoner of these
four men on this lonely island. For it was a
lonely island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though nearer that end of the lake where
Shopton was located, still this little irregular
circle of land, rocks, and shrubbery known as
Loon Island was a lonesome place. Its name
might indicate that, for in times past many
loons made their nesting place on the island, and
the loon is a very shy bird—it loves not human
company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t much chance of any one visiting
here to rescue me,” mused Tom to himself as he
submitted tamely to being bound. That is,
he submitted with seeming tameness, making
no struggle. But, truth to tell, he was boiling
within at the indignity put upon him and he
was wild with righteous rage against the men for
their threats to steal his idea of the great airline
express.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, there was nothing to do now but to
let the four scoundrels work their will upon him.
They were not unduly rough, but they took
great care in the tying of the ropes. Then one
of them noticed the ring of iron and the few
dangling links on Tom’s leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He filed off the chain!” exclaimed one of
the masked man. Like his companion he kept
his face covered. As for Kenny and Schlump,
they did not appear to mind being recognized.
Perhaps they felt that Tom would know them
even with masks on, so they did not go to the
trouble to disguise themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I have never seen the other two, and
that’s why they want to hide their faces from
me,” mused Tom. “They don’t want me to
recognize them again if I should happen to
see them with their masks off. But I may,
for all of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had keen and observing eyes, and now,
foiled in an attempt to see the faces of the two
masked men, he began studying their peculiarities
so he might know them again. He studied
their walk, their actions, the way in which they
used their hands and the tones of their voices.
Often a person may be recognized by his voice
alone. And Tom remembered how he had
recognized Renwick Fawn by that man’s elbow
peculiarity. But he could not place these two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he filed the chain off all right,” admitted
Kenny. “We might have known he’d
do something like that. We should have bound
his hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re bound now,” grimly remarked
Schlump, as he tightened the knots on the rope
around Tom’s wrists. It was so closely drawn
as to be painful, but Tom did not murmur.
He was not going to let these men know that
they were hurting him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d better take that leg bracelet off,” went
on one of the masked men, the larger of the two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why so?” asked Schlump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because the links on it might rattle just at
the wrong minute,” was the answer, and the
man made a peculiar motion, pointing off to
the mainland which Tom could see in the
distance as he stood on Loon Island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments the young inventor was
freed from the leg-iron. It was not heavy, and
gave him no particular discomfort, but, all the
same, he was glad to be rid of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Made me feel too much like an old slave on
the chain gang,” he told himself. What the
man had said about the necessity of keeping
quiet on Loon Island came to Tom with force
now. He had a wild idea of setting up a yelling
that might attract some passing oarsman or
motor boat man. But he gave this idea up
very soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might get help, and then, again, I might
not,” Tom thought. “If I didn’t get it, these
fellows would be angry at me and they might
beat me up. I want to keep a whole skin as
long as I can. I can do better work if I’m not
injured. I wonder what their game is, anyhow?
It’s a bold one—I’ll say that. And to
think I made it easier for them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For that is exactly what Tom had done.
Thinking it over as best he could amid the whirl
of ideas in his brain, he came to the conclusion
that he had fallen into his present plight purely
by accident. The men could not have known
that he would follow that mysterious, disappearing
stranger. They could not have known he
would go down the flight of secret steps. But
he had, through a chain of circumstances, and
when the scoundrels found him in their power
they proceeded with their plans. Tom had
actually played into their hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course he might have escaped had the
motor boat contained but another quart of
gasoline, but this was one of the times when
Fate played against the young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having made their prisoner secure, leaving
one of their number to watch him, three of
the men went down to the two boats. Tom
could hear them laughing as they discovered the
plight of the craft he had jumped into.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good thing you were short on gas, Kenny!”
some one said. “Otherwise he might be on the
mainland now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” was the answer. “Well, he’ll be on
mainland, anyhow, by night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom wondered what this meant. But
Schlump, who was guarding him, gave no sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the remainder of that day Tom remained
a prisoner on Loon Island with the four men
watching him. They seemed to have some
human feelings, for they gave Tom water to
drink and loosed his hands so that he could eat
some of the food they brought to him from the
boat in which they had pursued him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoner was grateful for the food, and
more so for the hot coffee, which Kenny made
over a fire he kindled. This coffee put heart
into Tom, and he felt much better after drinking
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was worried, not so much over his own
plight, as over what his father and his friends
might think about his sudden and mysterious
disappearance. That his father would worry,
Tom well knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom would not give his enemies the
satisfaction of asking them their intentions.
He preferred to wait and see what would
happen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must be going to take me to the mainland,”
thought Tom, as he recalled what had
been said. “It’s hard to tell whether I’ll have
a better chance to escape there or here. I’ll
just have to bide my time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed that the day would never pass,
but at length the shadows grew longer and
Tom, who had been thrust into a rocky cranny
behind a clump of bushes, realized that night
was settling down. It would be the second
night of his absence from home and he could
imagine the anxiety among his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They won’t know what to think,” reasoned
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before dark another meal was served to
the prisoner, and then one of the masked men
approached the young inventor with a gag in
his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to wear this,” he said roughly.
“I wouldn’t trust your promise not to yell
when we’re crossing the lake. I’m going to
fix it so you can’t shout for help!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this he did, binding Tom’s mouth
securely. It was impossible for him to make
himself heard five feet away. Then, when the
ropes on his legs and ankles were looked to and
made more secure, the prisoner was lifted by
two of the men and carried to the larger boat—the
one in which the scoundrels had pursued
the youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was laid down, with no great gentleness,
on one of the side seats, and a little later, under
cover of darkness, the trip from Loon Island
to the main shore was begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where he was landed Tom did not know—he
could not see any familiar landmarks. Nor
was he given much time to look about, for no
sooner had he been carried out of the boat than
he was bundled into a waiting auto and the
machine was driven off over a rough road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the unevenness of the highway and by
the damp smell all about him, Tom concluded
that he was being taken through the woods.
For an hour or more the journey lasted and then
he saw that the machine had stopped in front
of a lonely house set in the midst of the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sound of the screeching brakes of the
auto a door of this house opened, letting out a
flood of light, and a voice asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you got him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We sure have!” answered Kenny. “Anybody
been here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a soul. It’s as quiet as the grave.
Take him right upstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Tom quite realized what was happening
he felt himself being carried up a flight of
steps. He knew he was being taken into a
small room, which, from the closeness of the air,
seemed not to have been opened for a long time.
He was placed on a pile of bags, or something
soft on the floor, and a moment later his captors
hurriedly left, locking the door behind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this is worse and more of it!” mused
Tom, as he lay still a moment. He was on his
back. His position was most uncomfortable
and he began to roll over cautiously. He did
not know but what there might be holes or trap-doors
in the floor. He did not want to fall
through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got over on his side and then, to his delight,
he felt the gag loosening in his mouth.
By rubbing it on his shoulder he managed to
get free of it, and this was a great relief. He
could breathe more freely now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moving cautiously around, his eyes saw a
little sliver of light coming through a crack in
the floor. Getting as near this as he could,
Tom looked down. He saw below him, gathered
about the table, five men. Two were
Kenny and Schlump. The other two he saw
were his other captors, the masked men. The
fifth man seemed to be the keeper of the lonely
cabin. They were talking in cautious tones, but
the crack in the floor acted as a sort of speaking
tube, and Tom thus heard mention of the plot
against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we can’t do anything else,” muttered one
of the men, “we’ll blow up the Swift plant and
those airline express models, too. Then there
will be no question about us getting the patent.
That’s what we’ll do—we’ll blow up the plant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?” some one asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow!” came the quick answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom felt a sinking at his heart. Here he was,
bound and helpless, in the hands of his enemies
who were hatching a vile plot against him and
his father. Blow up the Swift plant! It was
terrible to contemplate!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom began to struggle fiercely to release himself.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch8'>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MR. DAMON’S NEWS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my gasoline tank, I’m afraid I’ve
done some damage!” cried Wakefield Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you haven’t damaged yourself you’re
lucky,” grimly commented Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I guess I’m all right,” said the eccentric
man as he climbed out of his plane. He had
managed to bring it to a level landing on the
ground, though it was more by good luck than
by good management.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had flown over from Waterfield in the
early morning, and either had not seen, or else
had forgotten about, Tom’s new mooring mast
on the edge of the landing field. Straight for
the big steel pole Mr. Damon had steered his
craft, to swerve it at the last moment so that
only one edge of a wing scraped it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, that impact was sufficiently forceful
to snap off the top of the mast and crumple
the airship’s wing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got out of that pretty well,” commented
Ned, as he made sure, half by feeling
and half by an inspection of the odd man, that
he was not injured. A casual inspection
proved, too, that the plane was not as badly
damaged as at first feared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry about that mooring mast,” said
Mr. Damon. “You must tell Tom to send me
the bill for repairing it, Mr. Swift. By the
way, where is Tom? I have some news for
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked about the assembled group formed
by Ned, Mr. Swift, Koku, and Eradicate. Something
of their anxiety must have showed on their
faces, for Mr. Damon asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has anything happened to Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t know,” answered Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t find him,” went on Mr. Swift
gravely. “Do you know where he is, Mr.
Damon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me? No, I haven’t seen him,” was the
answer. “But I have some news, just the
same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“News!” cried Ned. “What kind of news?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not very good, I’m afraid. I’ll tell you
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you come to be flying so early in
the morning?” Ned wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came over specially to tell Tom the news,”
was the answer. “I thought flying would be
the quickest way. I tried to telephone, but
I couldn’t raise you on the wire, Mr. Swift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have been using the wires to communicate
with different parts of the plant,” said the
old inventor. “That is probably why you
could not get us. But I am anxious to hear
anything about Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could give you direct news of him,”
went on Mr. Damon. “Bless my rubber boots!
I’m so excited I hardly know which end I’m
standing on—what with colliding with the
mooring mast and all that! I wonder if I have
damaged my new plane much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much,” Ned reassured him. “We can
soon put it in shape for you. But you can
hardly fly back in it, and you might as well
come into the private office and tell what you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later, Koku and Eradicate having
been sent to the house to tell Mrs. Baggert to
telephone out to the works in case Tom arrived
home, Mr. Swift, Ned, and Mr. Damon faced
each other in the private office of the missing
young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s all this about Tom not being
found?” Mr. Damon wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly Ned told what had happened—that
he had seen Tom outside the big fence, that the
young inventor was expected to call on Mary,
and that he had not appeared at the young
lady’s house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And since then we can’t find a trace of him,”
concluded Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what I heard a little while ago may
serve as a clew,” stated Mr. Damon. “Let
me see now, where shall I begin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned was so impatient that he felt like telling
the odd man to put on plenty of steam and
begin anywhere that would give news of Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the “blessing man,” as the old colored
servant called Mr. Damon, must do a thing in
his own way or not at all, and he was not to
be hurried. So, having marshaled in his own
mind what he wanted to say, he began:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been away on a business trip and I
only arrived home at two o’clock this morning.
I got off the sleeper at the station, and, feeling
hungry, I went into one of those lunch wagons
across the street to get a bite to eat before going
home and to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, while I was eating in this lunch
wagon, and I must say the cook has a very
clever way of frying eggs—while I was there
two men came in—no, it was three men—wait
a moment now, I can’t quite be sure of that,”
and to Ned’s exasperation Mr. Damon began
examining his own recollection to make sure
whether it was three or two men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I remember!” he exclaimed triumphantly,
to Ned’s great relief. “First two men
came in, and then, later, a third. The first
two were queer individuals—I thought they
might be criminals, ‘stick-up men,’ you know,
and I guess the fellow who ran the lunch wagon
did, also, for I saw him slip his revolver out
from a drawer and put it near the gas stove
where he could get it in a hurry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there was no need. The men were
quiet enough. They ordered hamburger steak
and onions—a vile combination, I’ll say—and
coffee. While they were eating the third man
came in—now I have it right—and as soon as
the two who had previously entered saw him
one of them asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about our quick friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The speedy one is chained up where he
can’t do any harm,’ is what the third man said.
Then they laughed and the third man also
ordered hamburger steak and onions and they
began to eat as if they were half-starved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t pay much attention to them at the
time, for I was in a hurry to get home—I had
told my wife I would arrive at midnight, but the
train was late and I knew I’d have to explain
why I was out at that hour. So I hurried up
with my meal and was coming out when one
of the men happened to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, this will put the airline express matter
right in our hands!’ It wasn’t until then,
as I was coming out and heard this remark, that
I began to suspect something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The airline express!” exclaimed Mr. Swift.
“Why, that’s Tom’s latest idea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it is,” said Mr. Damon. “That’s
what made me suspicious. Then I put two
and two together—they had spoken about ‘our
quick friend,’ and the ‘speedy one,’ and now I
know by those words that they meant Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It begins to look like that!” cried Ned.
“But what was it they said about him—that
he was tied up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Chained up,’ was the expression they used,”
Mr. Damon said. “I at once made up my mind
that some of Tom’s enemies were plotting
against him and I decided to come right over
and let him know. I waited a moment after
coming out of the lunch wagon, and saw the
three plotters disappear down a street that led
to a wharf on Lake Carlopa. Then I caught a
night-cruising taxi and made for my hangar.
I decided to try to call you first by telephone,
and, if I couldn’t raise you to warn you to look
out, I would aeroplane over and give the alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I couldn’t get you on the wire, so I
roused my mechanic and we wheeled the plane
out to my landing field. I didn’t even bother to
call up my wife, for I knew she wouldn’t let me
go, and I started off and—here I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky to be here, too, after hitting that
mast,” murmured Ned. “But what do you
think this all means?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means trouble for Tom, I’m sure of that,”
said Mr. Swift. “His enemies have captured
him, I’m afraid. That’s what that talk about
being chained up means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does look suspicious,” agreed Ned.
“We’d better start at the beginning again and
make another search. We can do it better now
that we have daylight. Tom has certainly disappeared
in a very mysterious manner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can count on me to help!” cried Mr.
Damon. “Bless my police whistle, but I wish
I had grabbed those three scoundrels when I
had the chance! They have Tom a prisoner,
I’m sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” suddenly exclaimed Ned, holding
up a warning hand. “Some one is coming!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>KOKU’S ALARM</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Footsteps could be heard coming along the
hall that led to the private office where Ned,
Mr. Damon, and Mr. Swift were conferring
over the mysterious disappearance of Tom
Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That isn’t Eradicate or Koku,” observed
Ned, for well he knew the curious, shuffling
gait of the colored man and the heavy tread
of the giant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds like a lady,” announced Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably Mrs. Baggert,” said Mr. Swift.
“She will be terribly anxious about Tom—she’s
like a mother to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not the kind, elderly housekeeper.
A moment later Mary Nestor hurried into the
room, her face and manner showing that she
was worried and excited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you found Tom?” was her first inquiry,
even before she nodded in greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Tom hasn’t showed up yet,” Ned
answered with as much cheerfulness as he could
put into his voice. “But he’ll be along soon—we
hope.” He felt forced to add that last, for
as the hours passed and no word came from Tom,
even the optimistic Ned began to lose heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it was that Mary Nestor showed her
true grit and spirit. Instead of sitting down
and sighing or crying, she assumed a firm air
and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When he didn’t come over last night I had
a feeling that something had happened to him.
I can’t explain it, but I had that feeling. Now
what have you done to find him, and what else
remains to be done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s system for you!” exclaimed Ned admiringly.
“Well, here’s the situation.” Then
he related to Mary what they knew of the
case, stating that he had met Tom the evening
before just outside the big fence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then that was the last any one has seen of
him?” said the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the last, as far as we can find out,”
Ned answered. “When all the men report for
work we will have each one questioned. It is
possible some of them may have seen Tom after
I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this hope soon faded. A check-up of the
entire factory force resulted in nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next thing to do,” decided Mary, “is
to begin at the point where you saw him, Ned,
and make a careful examination of the ground,
to see if there is any evidence of a struggle. It
is possible that Tom was overpowered and
carried off soon after you left him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how that could happen without
his giving an alarm,” answered the young
financial manager of the Swift plant. “But
we’ll go over that place with a fine tooth comb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the help of Mr. Damon and Mr. Nestor,
who had followed his daughter, this was done.
Of course Koku and Eradicate insisted on joining
in the search, and had it not been that the
matter was now getting serious it would have
been laughable to watch the giant and the
colored man. Each was jealous of the other,
each was fearful that the other would be the
first to discover Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But nothing was found that would indicate
in any way what had happened to the youthful
inventor. The men who had used the secret
flight of steps and the tunnel to carry Tom away
had returned soon after overpowering him and
had covered the opening to the underground
stairs, scattering earth and débris over the planks
so that a casual examination would disclose
nothing wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A closer inspection might have disclosed signs
of fresh earth scattered about, but this kind of
examination was not made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time every one connected with the
Swift factory knew of the young inventor’s disappearance,
and work was ordered stopped for
a time while a minute search was begun. Tom
was looked for in all possible and in some impossible
places, but all to no effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day passed. Mary remained at the
Swift house in order to be close at hand if Tom
should return unexpectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned began to look and feel blue and depressed
when night came again and there was
no sign of Tom. But, in contrast to this, Mary
was outwardly more cheerful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somehow,” she said, “I feel that we shall
have news of Tom before morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you think so?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know—but I have that feeling,”
answered the girl. “You know if Tom has
been caught and taken away, night would be
the best time for him to escape, wouldn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it would,” admitted Ned. “But I
can’t believe that he has been captured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can,” Mary asserted. “I have had a feeling
for some time that Tom would be in danger
as soon as he tried to go ahead with that new
invention of his—the airline express. It always
has happened so from the time he made his first
speedy motor boat until he put his valuable
papers in the Chest of Secrets. Always some
enemies have been on his trail. And you don’t
imagine they’re going to stop and let him alone,
do you, when he’s got something as big as this
airline express almost perfected?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course there are always scoundrels
ready to take advantage of what an inventor
does,” admitted Ned. “But this airline express
has been kept so secret I thought only a few
of us knew of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Tom hoped,” Mary said.
“But only a few days ago he told me he had
had to discharge two men because he suspected
them. I forget their names—something like
Renny and Hemp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kenny and Schlump,” corrected Ned. “Yes,
he told me about those men. But still, and
with all you have said, I can’t believe Tom has
been captured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day passed and night came. Mr. Swift
remained at the private office in the plant until
nearly ten o’clock, hoping that some word would
come from Tom; but none did, and an hour
later Mr. Damon insisted on taking the old
inventor home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Koku and I will stay here,” volunteered Ned.
“And, after all, Tom is as likely to go home or
send some word there as he is to come to the
plant. So we can divide our forces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was done, and Ned and the giant settled
themselves down for the night’s vigil. Several
hours passed, and all was quiet at the plant.
Ned was dozing when the big man, who had
been sitting at a window from which he had
a view of the big fence, suddenly arose and
whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody coming? What do you mean,
Koku?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man try climb fence,” went on the giant,
pointing out of the window. “Koku see him!
Koku get him! Bust him all up in slats!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute!” cautioned Ned, as he
caught hold of the big man who was about to
rush from the room. “No one can get over,
through, or under that fence without setting off
the alarm. It would ring here as well as in
other parts of the plant, Koku, and the bell
hasn’t tinkled. You must have fallen asleep
and dreamed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Koku saw man on fence!” insisted the giant.
“Maybe so him cut alarm wires.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even cutting the wires would ring a bell,”
insisted Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe Master Tom hisself come and try
get away from bad mans by climb fence,” went
on the giant, whose English left much to be
desired. “Master Tom—he know how climb
fence and no ring bell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s possible,” admitted Ned. “Tom
rigged up the burglar alarm on the fence and
he might know a way to beat his own game.
Maybe you’re right after all, Koku. We’ll go
and take a look. Where did you see the man
on the fence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” said the giant, and he pointed out
the place to Ned, who stood beside him in the
open window. “Look—there him now!” cried
the big man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned had a glimpse of a figure trying to scale
the high fence. In the darkness, illuminated
only by a little light from the waning moon,
the young financial man could not be sure
whether it was a man or an animal. Even then
he was wondering how it was possible for any
creature to get up on the fence without sounding
the alarm. And while Ned was thus wondering
the alarm went off with a sudden clang that
was startling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we catch ’um!” cried Koku, as he
raced from the room, followed by Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alarm, ringing simultaneously in different
parts of the plant, summoned a number
of watchmen. As the alarm gave the location
on the fence where the attempt had been made
to scale it, the forces gathered there, Koku
and Ned being the first to arrive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when a search was made with oil lanterns
and electric torches no trace of an intruder
could be found. The ground was hard and dry
near the fence and no footprints were observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ned and the giant were sure an attempt
had been made by some man to get into the
Swift plant. That this was not Tom went
without saying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They had Tom a captive somewhere,” said
Ned later, when he related the incident to Mr.
Damon and Mr. Swift. “And thinking that
with Tom out of the way it was safe to try to
get in, that’s what they did. But they didn’t
count on the electric alarm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we could have caught that fellow!”
murmured Mr. Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d ’a’ kotched him ef I’d a bin dar!” declared
Eradicate with a scornful glance at the
giant. “Dat big man am too stiff to run!
Better let ole ’Rad stay on guard de rest ob de
night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hu!” taunted Koku. “Yo’ so small burglar
man eat yo’ up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remainder of the night brought nothing
further—neither an alarm nor a capture.
Morning came, the second day of Tom’s disappearance,
a disappearance that was just as
strange as at first. Mary and the others were
greatly worried now, and Mr. Swift was beginning
to think that it would be best to notify the
police and broadcast his son’s disappearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the afternoon, when Ned, Mr.
Damon, Mary, and Mr. Swift were in the private
office discussing plans, that the telephone
bell rang. Ned made a jump for it, for though
the signal had sounded several times during the
day, each time only to have some routine
work matter discussed over the instrument, still
every time he heard the bell Ned felt certain
it was a message from Tom. And this time
his hopes were rewarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello! Hello!” called Ned into the transmitter.
Then, as he listened, what he heard
made his eyes open wide with wonder. For
over the wire came the voice of the young inventor
himself, though faint and showing evidences
of a great strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Ned!” came from Tom. “I’ve just
escaped! Watch the plant! Get Father to
safety. Look out for bombs! I’ll try——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the voice died away to silence.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch10'>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>TOM’S PLIGHT</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Desperation gave Tom Swift unusual
strength as he lay bound and seemingly helpless
in that upper story of the lonely cabin. Though
the ropes about his wrists and ankles seemed
very tight, he had a feeling as he strained his
arms that he was going to get free. That talk
he heard, floating up from the room below
where, through the crack, he could see the conspirators
gathered, gave him fierce energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s their game, is it?” mused Tom, as
he heard the plot to blow up the plant. “They
want to put me out of the way so they will
have a free hand to wreck my plant and get the
plans and models of the airline express cars and
airships. I don’t believe they ever thought of
inventing that sort of combination craft themselves.
They are trying to steal my ideas.
Kenny and Schlump must have hatched the
plot. Oh, but I’ve got to get loose and warn
Dad and Ned!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was this very necessity for quick action
that emboldened Tom and gave him the fierce
energy to struggle to get free of his bonds. He
was glad the gag had come loose, for with that
in his mouth, hindering his breathing, he could
not have worked as hard as he did—he would
have suffocated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now he could breathe easily, and he had
need of all his spare wind in the exertions that
followed the overhearing of the plot of the men
who had captured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily ropes, however strong, are capable
of being stretched if one pulls on them long
enough and often enough. And though it hurt
Tom to force his bare wrists against the hemp
strands, he kept at it until he found he could
move his hands more freely. He wished he
might find a projecting nail or some sharp
object in his prison, against which he could rub
his bonds to sever them. But he dared not roll
about much for fear of making a noise and so
bringing his captors upstairs. Once they discovered
that he was making an attempt to
escape, they might chain him fast or move him
to some other prison whence it would not be so
easy to get away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once I’m free of these ropes I know I can
get out,” Tom told himself. “I’m only on the
second floor, I can tell that, for I counted the
stairs as they carried me up. And if I can get a
window open I can jump to the ground, if I
don’t find some sort of a vine or a rain-water
pipe that I can climb down. But the first
thing to do is to get these ropes off my hands
and feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom knew that once his hands were freed
it would be a comparatively easy matter to
loosen the ropes on his ankles. All his energies,
then, must center on his hands. They were
tied behind his back, with several coils of rope
wound about the wrists. Again and again
Tom strained on these until, at last, he felt that
he could draw out one hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not easy, even when he had done this
much, but he kept at it, and finally had one
hand altogether freed. The exertion had made
him sweat and had tired him greatly. He
panted for breath as he lay there, while below
him he could hear the murmuring voices of the
plotters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little rest brought back Tom’s breath and
gave him renewed strength for what he had yet
to do, which was to free his ankles. But he had
accomplished the hardest part, which was to
get his hands loose. It was not easy, however,
to loosen the knots in the ropes about his feet,
and it was several hours before he managed to
free himself completely. One reason for this
was the tightness of the knots, and another
was that, occasionally one or more of the men
below would come upstairs and flash a gleam
from an electric torch into the room where Tom
was a prisoner, to make sure he was still safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the young man could tell, by the movement
of chairs below, when this inspection was
coming, and each time he was ready for it.
He assumed on the floor the same position he
had held when still bound and he wound the
ropes back again on his wrists so it could not be
seen, from a casual inspection, that they were
loose. And he also placed the gag in his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because of the necessity for stopping work
every now and then to assume the position of
a bound prisoner, Tom was longer engaged in
freeing his feet than otherwise would have been
the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Consequently it was almost morning when he
was able to stand up and move about freely.
Cautiously he crossed the room, pausing at
every board to make sure it would not squeak
and betray him, and at last he reached a window
through which the faint rosy streaks of dawn
were coming—the second morning that Tom
had been away from home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now to see if I can get this window open,”
mused Tom. He scarcely hoped to find that
it would open readily, and he was not greatly
disappointed when he found it fastened. By
the morning light, now growing stronger, and by
feeling, he ascertained that the sash was held
down by nails driven over the edges of it into
the frame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A claw hammer would have taken these nails
out in a second of time, but Tom had no claw
hammer, and the files by which he had removed
the chain from his leg had been taken from
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But maybe by bending the nail back and
forth often enough I can either loosen it enough
to pull it out or I can break it off,” he told himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt that he must now work quickly.
For some time there had been silence in the
rooms below him, and he guessed that his
captors were sleeping, thinking him securely
bound and locked in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they’ll awake soon and start getting
breakfast,” Tom decided. “They’ll bring me
up some, and then they’ll see that I have
loosened the ropes. I’ve got to get away before
they come up to feed me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His fingers sought a wedging nail and began
to bend it back and forth. At first it gave only
a little, but eventually it moved more and Tom’s
hopes rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now getting lighter every minute.
Tom felt that each moment was precious.
Unless he got the window open soon and could
manage to escape through it, he would be discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” he exclaimed with a breath of relief
as he at last broke off one nail. “Now for
the other.” The second proved easier, for
after working it backward and forward a number
of times and twisting it about, Tom pulled
it out. Now the window could be raised, and
this he did cautiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited a moment after lifting the sash
and listened. There was no sound from below,
and he thought that the men were still sleeping.
He put his head out and looked down. To
his dismay the window was higher above the
ground than he had hoped, and there was on
that side of the house neither a vine nor a rain-water
pipe that he could descend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to jump for it!” he grimly decided.
“But that grass below looks soft.” There was
a big clump of green below the window. Tom
climbed out, sat down on the sill, edged himself
over and then hung by his hands a moment.
This reduced the length of his drop by his own
height. He hung there a moment and then let
go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down he plunged, coming to a stop on the
earth with a thud that shook him greatly. He
seemed to lose his breath and a sharp pain shot
through his left ankle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess I’ve sprained it,” he mused. The
pain was actually sickening, and made him feel
faint. Through an open window on the first
floor he heard some one exclaim:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was that noise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What noise?” asked another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounded like some one falling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess you were dreaming! Get up and
make some coffee. I’m half starved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said the one who had first
spoken. “But I’ll just have a look at that bird
upstairs. He’s cute—maybe he’s got away.
I’ll have a look at him before I get breakfast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to run for it—and right away!”
thought Tom desperately. “Though how I’m
going to do it with a sprained ankle is more than
I know. But it will never do to let them catch
me again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grass was tall and rank under the window.
It would afford the fugitive cover until
he could get to some better shelter. He began
crawling through it, deeming this safer than
trying to stand up and run. His concealment
would be better in this position and it would
take the strain off his hurt ankle. He hoped it
was only a sprain and not a break.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not crawled more than a hundred feet
from the old house before he heard coming from
it shouts that told that his escape had been
discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I’m in for it!” he mused. Just ahead
of him he saw a brook, not very deep but rather
wide. “If I stand up and run they’re sure to
see me,” he reasoned. “And if I crawl I’ll leave
a trail in the grass like a big snake. If I can get
to the brook and crawl along in that I may throw
them off the trail for a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed the best thing to do, and while the
men back at the house were running about “in
circles,” so to speak, Tom crawled to the brook,
and then, having no particular choice, since he
did not know where he was, he began crawling
upstream. He did not hope to throw his
enemies off his trail long in this way, nor did he.
They were soon shouting as they ran down the
grass-covered and weed-grown yard, for the open
window had told them which way he had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trick of going into the brook confused
them for a while, but Tom knew they would
separate into two parties and soon trace him.
He was desperate and at his wits’ end when he
saw just ahead of him on the edge of the stream
an old barrel, partly embedded in the sandy
shore. He could get into this without leaving
the water, and as its open end was turned
rather upstream he might escape observation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not take him long to get into the
barrel. He took care to leave no tell-tale trail,
and his strategy was well carried out, for a little
later, splashing their way upstream, ran two of
the men—Tom could see them through a hole
in the closed end of the barrel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’d better not stay here,” the lad mused.
“They’re sure to come back, and the next time
they might take a notion to investigate this
barrel. I’ll strike across country until I get to a
house. There must be people living around
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom never liked, afterward, to recall that
journey. It was a painful one because of his
injured ankle. He got a tree branch, which he
used as a crutch and hobbled along on that.
Once or twice he fainted and sank to earth in a
stupor. How long these periods of unconsciousness
lasted he could not tell. He dared not call
out for fear of bringing the men on his trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the woods and across a swamp he
pulled himself along, and at last, in the afternoon,
as he could tell by the sun, he dragged
himself out on a road and saw a white farmhouse
a little way down it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I guess I’m all right now,” faltered the
exhausted youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a much surprised farmer who a little
later saw a tall young man, obviously hurt,
almost crawling up the front walk. Before the
farmer could ask any questions Tom shot one
at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to get an important message off at
once. Have you a telephone? I’ll pay for
using it!” There was something businesslike in
Tom’s voice, weak and weary as it was, that
impelled the farmer’s respect in spite of Tom’s
rather disreputable appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in,” the man invited. “Looks to me
like you’d better telephone for a doctor while
you’re at it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That can wait,” gasped Tom. “Something
else is more important. Show me the telephone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later he was gasping to Ned his
message:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just escaped! Watch the plant! Get Father
to safety. Look out for bombs. I’ll try——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tom Swift fell over in a faint.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch11'>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE EXPLOSION</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>David Knowlton, the farmer upon whom
Tom had called so unceremoniously, was scarcely
more surprised by the sudden falling over of
the young man in a faint than he had been at his
eager request for a telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great bullfrogs!” cried Mr. Knowlton, as
he hurried to pick Tom up and lay him on a
lounge in the room. “What’s all this goings-on,
anyhow? What’s it all mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he dead?” asked Mrs. Knowlton, who
hurried into the room, having followed Tom and
her husband when she saw the stranger come
up to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, Sarah,” was the answer.
“But first hang that telephone back on the
hook. The inspector told me never to leave it
off when we weren’t using the line and I guess
this fellow is through using it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the telephone went back on the hook,
which defeated the plans of frantic Ned Newton,
on the other end, if not to hold further talk with
Tom, at least to learn from what station he was
telephoning his message of warning. In vain
did Ned appeal to the central operator to re-establish
the connection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless you know the number of the party
who called I can’t connect you,” she reported,
and Ned knew, from previous attempts, that it
was useless to carry the effort further. He
could only hope that Tom would call again to
relieve their minds. All they knew now was
that he was alive, but that something dire portended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Mr. and Mrs. Knowlton, kindly
souls that they were, ministered to Tom Swift.
The farmer’s wife brought out her bottle of
camphor, and a sniff of this potent spirit, with
some rubbed on his forehead, soon brought Tom
out of his faint. Then he was given a drink
of water, which further helped in restoring his
failing energies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they come for me, don’t let them get me!”
begged Tom, sitting up on the couch. “Help
me to get back! I must travel fast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need a doctor, that’s what you need,
young man!” decided Mr. Knowlton. “You
aren’t fit to travel. You’ve done too much of
that already, from the looks of you, and that
foot of yours is in bad shape,” he added, as he
saw the swollen ankle. Tom’s shoe laces were
almost bursting from the pressure of the swelled
flesh, and the farmer had to cut them to loosen
them. This gave Tom some relief, but the
hardships he had gone through, the anxiety, and
being without proper food so long, had so weakened
him that he went off in another faint
before he could tell his story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call Doctor Prouty,” advised Mrs. Knowlton.
“We’ll never get to the bottom of this
until this young man is in his right mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily the physician was in his office in the
village and drove out in his car as soon as the
farmer had telephoned. A hasty examination
showed that Tom was suffering from exhaustion
more than from anything else, and a little warm
milk, followed later by more substantial food,
soon gave the youth energy enough to tell the
main points of his story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if these men come after me—which they
may do,” he said to Mr. Knowlton, “you
won’t let them get me, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say not!” cried Mrs. Knowlton
before her husband could answer. “The idea!
You poor boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the doctor was giving some directions
as to what should be done for Tom, one of the
hired men on the place came to the door of the
room and reported:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a couple of men outside who want to
see you, Mr. Knowlton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right—I’ll see them,” answered the
farmer grimly. “Now don’t you worry!” he
told Tom, as the youth started to say something.
“Just leave ’em to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Knowlton found two unprepossessing
characters awaiting him on the side porch. He
recognized them at once from Tom’s description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen a young man passing here?”
asked one of the twain. “He has escaped from
an insane asylum and we want to take him back
before he can do any damage. He has a delusion
that he is a great inventor, named Tom
Swift, and he will likely tell a very plausible
story. Have you seen him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom Swift is in my house now,” said the
farmer slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he? That’s good! We’re glad you have
him safe!” cried the taller of the two men,
with a quick glance at his companion. “Poor
fellow—he needs care. We’ll look after him.
Much obliged for having taken him in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute,” went on the farmer, as the
two men endeavored to push past him into the
house. “Where are you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To get the patient and take him back to the
asylum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’d wait a bit about that if I were
you,” went on Mr. Knowlton grimly. “Now
look here,” he went on, producing a shotgun
from behind one of the porch pillars. “I’ll
give you fellows just one minute to run down
the road and make yourselves scarce in any
direction you like. Just one minute, and
several seconds of that have already passed!”
he added significantly, as he raised the gun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I say—look here!” broke out one of the
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half a minute gone!” said the inexorable
farmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t understand!” began the other
plotter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand how to use a shotgun!” said
Mr. Knowlton. “There’s about fifteen seconds
of that minute left and——” He cocked the
gun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the two men did not stay to argue longer.
With black looks and shaking their fists at the
imperturbable farmer, they ran out of the gate,
and with a grim chuckle Mr. Knowlton returned
to Tom to tell what had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you—a whole lot,” said the young
inventor. “They are desperate men. They
are going to blow up my factory. I must get
back at once and look after my father. He is
an old man—he may not take my telephone
warning seriously. Nor may Ned. I must go
there myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you aren’t fit to travel!” expostulated
Mrs. Knowlton. “One of the hired men could
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I must make the trip,” decided Tom.
“I’m all right now—except for my ankle.
Have you an auto?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, we have a flivver,” said the farmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then lend it to me—or sell it to me!” cried
Tom. “I must make this trip at once—before
night. Where is this place, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re in Birchville,” was the answer.
“It’s about thirty miles to Shopton from
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can make it!” cried Tom. “I can hobble
along and make the trip in the auto. You’ll
let me go, won’t you, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, since you’re so set on it, I reckon I’ll
have to. As you say, there’s nothing much the
matter except a sprained ankle, and if some one
will drive the car for you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll drive!” cried the farmer. “I want to
see this thing through now. I didn’t like the
looks of those fellows with their lie about an
escaped crazy man. I’ll drive you home, Tom
Swift!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later they were on the road, and
though the flivver made good time, still to Tom
it seemed only to crawl. It was evening now,
and rapidly getting dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before setting out he had again called
Ned on the wire, telling his manager where he
was, briefly relating what had happened, and
again warning about the danger of bombs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry, Tom,” Ned had ’phoned back.
“We’re so glad you’re safe; nothing else matters.
But we’ll be on our guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lights of Shopton were in view. Mr.
Knowlton drove his car down the slope that led
to the Swift plant, the electric gleams of which
could be made out now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess everything’s all right,” Tom said,
with a note of relief in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had hardly spoken than there came
the sound of a loud explosion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There goes something!” cried the farmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid so!” exclaimed Tom. “I wonder
if that was at my plant? Oh, I do hope Ned
and my father took all precautions!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the echoes of the explosion died away the
little car carrying Tom and the farmer lurched
forward.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch12'>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A DANGEROUS SEARCH</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after receiving the mysterious
message from Tom, a message that seemed to
come out of the air, Ned Newton made a frantic
effort to get the operator at central to trace the
call. But if one has ever tried to do this he
knows how difficult it is. Unless one can give
the telephone number of the party to whom he
has been talking, and who made the call, if one
is cut off there is little chance of the communication
being re-established. Ned found this out
to his sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is his number?” asked the telephone
girl in a matter-of-fact way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His number? Great Scott, didn’t I tell
you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give you the manager,” went on the
bored operator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the manager could give no more satisfaction
than his helper. He promised to trace
the call and let Ned know what success he had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I know what the answer is already,”
Ned remarked in disgusted tones as he gave up
vainly rattling the hook. “We won’t hear
another word from Tom until he calls us himself.
But we are sure of one thing—he’s alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he give you any particulars?” asked
Mr. Swift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my telephone book, who’s been treating
him this way?” demanded Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned repeated the message as it came to him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just escaped! Watch the plant! Get Father
to safety! Look out for bombs! I’ll try——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the voice had died away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s as we suspected,” commented Ned.
“He has been captured by some of his enemies
and held a captive up to a little while ago.
Then he got away. Good old Tom! You can
depend on him for that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it seems to me we should do something,”
declared Mary, very much in earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my eyeglasses, that’s what I say!”
cried Mr. Damon. “Come on—we’ll get in my
airship—it must be repaired by this time—and
we’ll rescue Tom! Don’t lose any more time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we don’t know where he is,” said Ned.
“It would be worse than useless to go scouring
around the country looking for Tom in an airship.
He might be only five miles from here
or he might be five hundred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Mary Nestor. “The thing
for us to do is to follow Tom’s advice—watch
the plant, get Mr. Swift to a place of safety, and
look out for bombs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you actually going to hunt through the
plant for hidden bombs?” demanded Mr.
Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” Ned answered. “It’s the only
thing to do after Tom’s warning message.
While I don’t know what the game is, I think it
likely that his enemies kidnapped Tom to get
him out of the way so they could have a free
run of the plant to search for and take away
his models and papers of the newest invention—the
airline express. Well, they got Tom, but
he managed to escape, and their first attempt
to sneak into the plant was a failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now they may have secreted some time
bombs around the place. These may go off
any minute, but, it is probable, they have been
set to explode after dark. They hope to throw
the place into confusion, and then to rush in and
get what they want. But Tom has put us on
guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Mr. Damon. “Then, as I
understand it, we are now going to search for
bombs that may go off at any minute?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” assented Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m glad I carry a large accident
insurance,” said the eccentric man, forgetting
to bless anything just then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there may not be much danger,” Ned
stated. “If the plotters hope to get Tom’s
models and papers it isn’t likely they would
use bombs of very great force. To do so would
be to blow things so much apart that they
couldn’t get anything out of the ruins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I think they will use bombs with only a
small charge of explosive—enough to make a lot
of noise, smoke, and confusion. But if we can
find them first—the bombs, I mean—and put
them out of business, we’ll be all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Mr. Damon, “providing they
don’t find us first and put us out of business.
It doesn’t take much of a bomb to blow a man
sky-high.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” grimly admitted Ned. “But that’s
the chance we have to take.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s a chance,” said the odd man, and
then he and Ned began their perilous work—for
it was perilous in spite of what the young
manager had said—while Mr. Swift and Mary
Nestor returned to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heads of the various factory departments
were called into consultation and instructions
given them to search their respective quarters
with minute care to discover any possible
bombs. Koku and Eradicate were also called
in and with Ned and Mr. Damon formed a
separate searching party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Koku who found the first bomb. The
giant was looking in a pile of rubbish in one
corner of a certain shop when he made a dive
for something and cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cannon ball—like strong man throw in
circus. I stronger than circus man—I toss
cannon ball!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned was just in time to stop him, for the
giant had picked up a round iron object and
was about to use it to exhibit his great strength
when the manager cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold it, Koku! That’s a bomb!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it proved to be—a bomb with a time
arrangement for firing it, set to go off in about
two hours. Ned quickly disconnected the
firing arrangement and the bomb was put in a
pail of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Efforts were redoubled to find the dangerous
“cannon balls,” as Koku called them, and in a
short time three more were discovered in various
parts of the plant. They were all set with time
fuses which had more than an hour yet to run,
so the bombs were rendered harmless with no
ill effects to the searchers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was when the shadows of evening were
falling, and Ned and the others had about given
up expectation of finding more bombs, that Ned
unexpectedly came across one hidden in a refuse
box outside of Tom’s private office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It needed but an instant’s look to show that
this was timed to go off almost immediately,
which fact, when Ned discovered it, caused
him to shout:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out! This is a live one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hurled it from him, toward a pile of lumber
in the shop yard. There was a deafening
report—a shower of planks and boards rose in
the air and settled back again with a crash,
while a cloud of smoke filled the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just in time!” cried Ned. “If that had
gone off here it would have killed all of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as the echoes of the explosion died away
a voice was heard shouting:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is any one hurt? Father, are you there?
Ned, is any one hurt?”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch13'>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>AN OMINOUS MESSAGE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Curious, indeed, was the chance, coincidence,
or fate—call it what you like—which brought
Tom Swift on the scene, in company with Mr.
Knowlton in the runabout, just as the bomb
which Ned tossed away exploded near the
lumber pile. Tom and his friend felt the force
of the blast, but, aside from a stunned feeling
and the shock, they were unhurt, and after a
momentary stopping of the car Mr. Knowlton
sent it on again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom was anxious to know what had
happened; hence his cry as he saw the flash
and heard the blast so near his plant and his volley
of questions as soon as Mr. Knowlton
brought the car to a final stop. And Ned,
hearing his friend’s cry, first marveled and
then rejoiced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom! Tom!” he shouted. “Are you
there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” was the answer. “But what happened?
Is my father all right?” There was so
much smoke from the bomb that Tom could not
see far ahead, especially as it was now dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father is all right—he’s back home
with Mary,” Ned informed Tom, as the latter
got out of the car to limp toward the entrance
gate near his private office. “And the plant isn’t
damaged. Come in and I’ll tell you about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are these your friends? Are you sure
everything is all right?” asked the cautious
farmer, as he saw Tom preparing to go in
through the big gate in the high fence. One
of the men had hastened to open it when it
was certain that Tom was outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, everything is all right,” was the
answer. “This is my factory—my friends are
here. But my enemies have been trying some
of their tricks. Luckily the tricks didn’t
work. But don’t go,” begged Tom. “I want
you to meet Ned Newton and my father.
He’ll want to thank you for aiding me—for
bringing me back here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, shucks! That wasn’t anything!” expostulated
Mr. Knowlton. “Anybody would
have done the same. I won’t stop now. I’m in
a hurry to get back home—my wife will be
worried. But she’ll be glad to know you got
here safe and found your friends. Come out
and see us some time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” promised Tom, and then as his
benefactor drove away, Tom and Ned rushed
toward each other to shake hands, while Mr.
Damon brought up the rear, murmuring:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my insurance policy! Bless my rubber
boots! If this isn’t most astonishing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you all right, Tom?” demanded Ned,
anxiously looking over his chum. “But you’re
hurt!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a sprained ankle,” explained Tom,
who was hobbling about. “I had to jump out
of a window. But is Dad all right? What was
that explosion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the bombs you warned us about.
We found four—this was the fifth and just about
to go off. I fired it away not a second too soon.
It chewed up some of your spare lumber. I
guess it’s the last. But where have you been?
After the first message of yours we didn’t know
what to think until you telephoned again that
you were on your way in. What’s it all about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trouble, I guess,” answered Tom. “Some
gang is after me and the new airline ideas and
patents. They’re desperate. Wait until I
’phone to the house to let Dad and Mary know
I’m all right, and then I’ll explain. Why,
hello, Mr. Damon!” Tom exclaimed as he saw
his eccentric friend. “Did they get you over
here to hunt bombs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He overheard some talk which gave us an
idea of the desperate men who were after you,”
stated Ned. “He came over in a hurry,
and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too much of a hurry, I guess,” broke in
Mr. Damon, in rather crestfallen tones. “I
smashed up your mooring mast, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a small matter—easily mended.
I’m glad you weren’t hurt. I’ll tell you everything
in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom limped into his office and soon was conversing
with his father and then, at more length,
with Mary. They were rejoiced to learn that
he had escaped and was safe. Then began the
telling of the two-sided story—the events leading
up to the explosion of the bomb Ned had
hurled away just as Tom arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom related how he had seen the strange
man disappear behind the bush, how he had
followed, had gone down the secret steps, and
how he awoke out of a doped stupor to find
himself a prisoner. Then he told of being
taken to the lonely house and how he had
escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned, in turn, related their anxiety when Tom
did not come home, and told how they had
searched for him before and after the arrival
of Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We sure were glad to hear your voice over
the wire,” Ned stated. “But somebody cut us
off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I fainted,” Tom explained, “and Mr.
Knowlton or his wife hung up the receiver without
trying to carry on the talk, which, if they
had done, would have told you everything.
But the doctor soon pulled me around and the
only thing really the matter with me now is
this swollen ankle. But that will soon go down
and then I’ll get after these fellows and finish
work on my airline express. Now tell me where
you found the bombs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned did, stating that one had been found near
Tom’s office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there may be more bombs,” Tom said.
“I won’t be satisfied until we have gone over all
this plant again. We can’t afford to take
chances. But I’ll move my airline express
models and patent papers—that is, the preliminary
ones—to a place of safety in my Chest
of Secrets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was done, and then another careful
search was made of the premises. No more
bombs were found and Tom announced his
intention of going home to get some much-needed
rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how do you suppose, with all your
guards, Tom, and the electrical fence, those
fellows planted the bombs?” asked Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” replied the young inventor.
“I’m afraid there is treachery somewhere in our
working force. Without the aid of confederates
those plotters couldn’t have put the bombs
in here. I’ll have to make an investigation.
But for the present the danger is past, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all in need of rest and quiet after
the exciting two days through which they had
passed, especially Tom, and when he reached
home Mrs. Baggert insisted on putting him
straight to bed, in which place, to tell the truth,
the young inventor was not at all averse to
spending some time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following day things had rather quieted
down at the plant. The resulting débris was
swept up, and the shattered lumber pile,
devastated by the bomb, was examined for
remnants of the infernal machine. Several
pieces of cast iron were picked up, and Tom
said he would investigate them to try to discover,
if possible, where the bomb was made.
It appeared to have contained no missiles,
being merely a hollow shell filled with explosives,
set to go off at a certain time, and Ned had
hurled it away not an instant too soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first thing we’ve got to do,” decided
Tom, a few days later, when he was able to be
about without his crutch and with much of his
former energy restored, “is to investigate that
secret stairway. Maybe some of the fellows are
still on Barn Door Island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the delay, short as it was, had given the
plotters time to vanish and to destroy some
of their work. The stairs were in place, but
after tearing up the planks, after the soil had
been swept away, there was revealed only a
blind passage. The tunnel had been caved in
a short distance from the secret steps and it
was impossible to traverse it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same conditions prevailed on Barn Door
Island. The place where Tom had emerged
from the tunnel was found, but a short distance
back in the passage dirt and rocks were piled
up, preventing a further examination being
made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe they’re walled up in the tunnel under
the lake,” suggested Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not likely,” Tom said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They probably cleared out after their bold
plan didn’t succeed,” Ned remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they’ve gone for a time,” Tom admitted.
“But that doesn’t mean it’s forever.
They’re still at large and they won’t give up so
easily. I’m afraid for the success of my airline
express plans. But I’m going to work on
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Tom’s fears were well grounded was
borne out a few days later when, as the young
inventor sat at his desk, his private telephone
rang. Tom’s own instrument had a number not
in the book and was known only to a few. Unless
this number were given to the central
operator Tom’s ’phone bell would not ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But ring it did on this occasion, and over the
wire came this ominous message:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out for yourself, Tom Swift! We’ll
get you yet!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch14'>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE AIRLINE EXPRESS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Like a flash Tom Swift realized that this
warning had come from those daring enemies
of his who were still at large—the same men,
Kenny and Schlump and the two masked ones,
who had kidnapped him. He could realize their
rage at his escape, their anger at the foiling of
their plot to blow the place up by bombs, or, if
their intention was not to cause serious damage,
but only confusion, during which they might
rob—this, too, had been frustrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the sinister character of all
that had taken place stunned the young
inventor. The danger under which he was,
came to him with a sickening realization and he
sat for a moment holding the receiver in his
nerveless hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was brought back to a sense of realities
by hearing the somewhat distant voice of the
operator asking:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What number, please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That stirred Tom into action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” he cried into the instrument.
“You don’t realize how important this is!
I’ve received a threat over the wire! I must
trace——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold the line,” interrupted the girl in a
matter-of-fact tone, and, for a moment, Tom
felt hopeful that he could thus get on the trail
of those who sought to injure him. But while
he was even thus hoping another voice broke
in on his thoughts saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the manager, have you any complaint
to make?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—no!” exclaimed Tom in despair, realizing
how useless it was to try to trace the call
thus. He was going through much the same
experience Ned had gone through the time Tom
called him from the farmhouse and then fainted.
“I’ll call and explain. This is Tom Swift speaking,”
he told the manager. “I want to trace
a call that came over my private wire, but I can
do it best by a personal visit, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will do all we can for you,” the manager
said, for she knew the Swift concern was a large
and important one. “It is often difficult to
trace stray calls that may be made from any of
a hundred pay stations. But I will help you all
I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Tom, and hung up the
receiver. Then he fell into deep thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he had feared, the danger was not over.
His enemies were only biding their time. They
had failed in their first efforts, but they were not
going to give up. The sinister threat was
enough to disclose that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deciding that quick action was the best way
to trace the mysterious call, Tom at once summoned
Ned and they visited the local telephone
exchange. There the records were gone over,
but aside from establishing the fact that the call
was put through from the Waterfield central,
nothing was established. From just what
station the threatening man had spoken, Tom
could not find out. That it was a man’s voice
he was certain, but whether or not it was one of
the four or five who had held him prisoner in
the lonely house Tom could not decide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there’s something in the fact that the
call came from Mr. Damon’s town,” said Ned.
“And he overheard men talking about you the
time he was eating in the lunch wagon. It
begins to look, Tom, as if the headquarters of
the gang was in or near Waterfield.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it does,” agreed Tom. “I think we’ll
take a run over there. I want to see Mr.
Damon on business, anyhow. And we can take
in that old house where they had me tied up. I
want to see if I can get any clews there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, a visit to the lonely shack, which
Tom located after some difficulty, was without
result. It had long been uninhabited, and the
owner, when found, said he knew nothing of the
men who had been in it. This Tom and Ned
could well believe. A search through the
premises revealed nothing of any value as a
clew. The ropes which Tom had discarded
when he made his escape had been taken away,
or it might have been possible to trace the place
where they had been bought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess Waterfield is our next and best
hope,” remarked Ned, as he and Tom came
away from the lonely house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so,” agreed the young inventor.
“Mr. Damon may have heard something more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found the odd man contemplating his
new plane, which had been repaired and taken
back to his own private hangar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Damon led his visitors to his private
office, and there Tom told the latest happenings.
But Mr. Damon was unable to throw any light
on this new development, nor was he able to
trace the men he had overheard talking in the
lunch wagon. He had tried to get the police
to locate them, but without avail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll let that go for the present,”
decided Tom. “Now for something else—my
latest idea, so to speak. I heard you say, the
other day, Mr. Damon, that you had some loose
funds you wished you could invest in a paying
undertaking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right, Tom, so I have, bless my bank-book!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m thinking of forming a company to
exploit my airline express. I find that a large
part of Father’s funds and mine are tied up
in such a way, in our other inventions, that I
can’t get enough ready cash in a hurry, and I
need considerable to start this new method of
travel. I thought perhaps you might be interested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I may be, Tom,” said Mr. Damon.
“Tell me about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s like this,” began the young inventor.
“You know over in Europe and here,
too, though to a much more limited extent,
great interest is being manifested in travel by
aeroplane—I mean travel by private parties.
They have aeroplanes now that carry ten or
twelve at a time over the English Channel.
You can also fly from Paris to Berlin and between
other European cities. In fact, they have
regular routes of travel there. But here we have
only a few which might be called experimental
if we exclude the air mail which is a great success
between New York and Chicago and
western points. Now what I plan is this:
An airline express from New York to San
Francisco, a straight-across-the-continent flight
by daylight—say from sunrise to sunset.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, Tom?” cried Wakefield
Damon. “Do you mean to tell me you
can build an aeroplane that will cross the
continent in twelve hours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in twelve hours, perhaps,” replied Tom,
with a smile. “Though I’m not ready to admit
that’s impossible. But there are more than
twelve hours from sunrise to sunset—or rather,
from dawn until dark. I’ll set the time at
sixteen hours. That ought to be easy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you spoke of making the trip continuously—without
change,” said Mr. Damon,
to whom Tom’s idea was not altogether new.
“None of the aeroplanes we have at present
can do that—it’s all of three thousand miles.
The British transatlantic fliers didn’t make as
long a journey as that, though of course they
were in more danger, flying over the ocean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably it wouldn’t be a non-stop flight,”
said Tom. “The air mail doesn’t do that—different
planes are used. It’s just the same
in making a transcontinental trip in a railroad
train. No one engine makes the entire trip, nor
does a single train crew. But it is possible to
get in a sleeping car in New York and stay in
the same car until you get to San Francisco.
The car is merely coupled to different engines,
made up into different trains at certain designated
places.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that your plan?” asked the odd man.
“I thought you said you were going to run
aeroplanes, not railroad cars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, if I can make a go of it,” replied the
young inventor. “But it will be a combination
aeroplane and railroad coach. Here is
my idea in a rough form.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid before Ned and Mr. Damon a sketch
of a large and powerful plane and also a sort of
coach on wheels. The two were shown separately
and in combination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” went on Tom, pointing out the
different features, “the passengers would take
their places in this coach—a sort of glorified
automobile—at the first landing field, on Long
Island. There this car, which will hold half a
dozen or more, will be fastened to the aeroplane
by clamps. The aeroplane will take off,
and make an airline for Chicago, which will be
the first of two stops to be made between New
York and the Pacific coast. Landing on the
Chicago field, the autocar will be detached and
rolled, under its own power, to the second
aeroplane which will be in waiting. It will be
clamped fast to the chassis, and if the passengers
happen to be asleep they will not be awakened,
any more than they would when a Pullman
sleeper is taken off one train and put on another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As soon as the car is clamped to the second
plane that one starts and flies to Denver. There
it descends, the car is rolled to the third plane,
in waiting, and that sets off, landing in San
Francisco about sixteen hours from the time the
start was made—a daylight trip across the
continent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can it be done?” asked Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so,” Tom answered. “I plan now on
making one trip each way every week. There
will be three laps of approximately one thousand
miles each. Figure five hours to a lap, that
would mean a flying rate of two hundred miles
an hour—not at all impossible. We’ll charge a
fare of one thousand dollars each way. There’ll
be money in it, Mr. Damon. Do you want to
go in with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead of answering Mr. Damon rose and
tiptoed his way softly to the door, where he
stood intently listening.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch15'>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A TRIAL FLIGHT</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift and Ned Newton watched the odd
man curiously. Afterward Ned said he thought
Mr. Damon had gone to the door to ascertain if
his wife might be eavesdropping, since she did
not altogether approve of many of the things he
did in connection with the young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought maybe he was going to get his
checkbook,” Tom said later. He was always a
very hopeful individual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when Mr. Damon returned to his seat
after his tiptoeing visit to the closed door he remarked
in a low voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t be too careful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About what?” asked Tom, impressed by his
friend’s manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About letting your plans become known
before you are ready to spring this new airline
express on the public,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you don’t suspect any one in your own
house, do you?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not my wife, of course,” Mr. Damon
answered. “But there have been several queer
characters around here of late. Several men
have called, trying to get me to hire them as a
valet. Bless my necktie, as if I needed a valet!
Of course I sent them away, but yesterday the
maid let another one in while I was busy in my
study, and the fellow had the impudence to walk
right up to my door. My wife caught him standing
there listening after the maid had gone away,
and Mrs. Damon sent the fellow flying, I’ll tell
you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suspect, Tom, that he had something to
do with the gang that is trying to get your new
apparatus away from you. He must know that
I am your friend and often go on trips with you,
and possibly he thought he might get some
information here, in a sneaking way. That’s
why I wanted to make sure no one was out in
the hall listening. It’s all right. I looked out
through the crack and no one is there. Now
go on with your explanation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom did, elaborating on his plans for a big
aeroplane in two sections, the part where the
passengers were to be carried being like a big
autocar, able to move under its own power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is this feature that will save a lot of
time,” he explained. “After the first aeroplane
starts from Long Island the passengers will not
have to move out of their seats until they reach
San Francisco. Or, if we start at night, in
case it is found desirable to have overnight
trips, a man can go to sleep in New York and
awaken at the Golden Gate, that is, if he wants
to sleep that long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a big undertaking!” said the odd man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Tom can carry it through if any one
can,” declared Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The worst of it is that it’s going to take a
mint of money,” sighed the young inventor.
“That’s why I’m calling on you and some of my
other friends to take stock, Mr. Damon. How
does it strike you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the credit of Mr. Damon be it said that he
did not hesitate a moment. He held out his
hand to his friend and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m with you, Tom Swift! I’ll invest all
I can afford. I wish it was more, but I’ve spent
a lot on that new aeroplane of mine that I nearly
smashed. However, I have a few dollars left
in the bank. Though you needn’t say anything
to my wife about this,” he went on in a low
voice as he got out his checkbook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and Ned smiled as they gave a promise
of secrecy, and a little later the young inventor
left with his first contribution toward financing
the airline express—a check for five thousand
dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift spent busy days during the next
few weeks. Like all new enterprises, this one
was not easy to start, though many of Tom’s
friends, whom he approached with a plea that
they buy stock which would pay big dividends
if the plan succeeded, at once purchased blocks.
Others required more persuasion, and not a few
said they would buy stock if they could see the
machines in operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what we’ve got to do, Ned,” decided
the young inventor, when it was evident that
the enterprise might fail through lack of
capital. “We’ve got to show these Missouri
birds that we can fly this combined auto and
aeroplane. Gee, I’m sorry now Dad and I have
all our ready money tied up in those other
matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But can you build a trial machine?” asked
the treasurer of the Swift concern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can as soon as my patent papers come
through from Washington,” Tom said. “That’s
where the hitch is now. After all the machines
we have made in our plant, it would be queer if
we couldn’t build a speedy aeroplane of extra
power and also a chassis to clamp on to carry
the passengers. That’s where the patent comes
in—the method of combining the two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I understood that the patents had been
allowed,” said Mr. Damon, who was present.
“That was the latest advice from your Washington
lawyer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know. But several matters have
come up since then. Some one is trying to
throw a monkey wrench into the gear wheels,
so to speak, and I suspect it is the same gang
that tried to put me out of the way—the
scoundrels headed by Schlump and Kenny. I
think I shall have to make a trip to Washington
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful, Tom,” warned Ned Newton.
“They may get you on the way there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I can look out for myself,” was the
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when Mary Nestor heard what Tom proposed
to do, she added her warning to Ned’s.
However, Tom was firm and then Mary delivered
her ultimatum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you go to Washington, I’m going, too,”
she declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” cried Tom. “I’ve been wanting
a little excursion with you, Mary, and we’ll
make a party of it and take Ned and Helen
along. That will be fun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the idea!” Ned declared. “It will
be a bold gang that dares to start anything with
the two girls along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be mentioned here that Tom’s patents
were really of a three-fold nature. One consisted
of the peculiar construction of the passenger
car to be used in the ocean-to-ocean flight,
the second was a patent on the method of
clamping this car to the aeroplane, and the
third covered the method of manufacturing
the duralumin alloy of which the car and a part
of the aeroplane were to be constructed.
Ordinary duralumin is composed of ninety-four
per cent. aluminum and the rest copper and
magnesium; but Tom had a secret formula of
his own, not only for mixing these ingredients,
but also in the melting and forging processes.
His duralumin he considered stronger than any
ever used in an aeroplane and it was at least
three per cent. lighter in weight than any which
had ever been offered to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is nothing like going yourself when you
want a thing done, as Tom found, and he had
not been many days in Washington, whither his
three friends accompanied him, before he had
matters connected with his patents straightened
out and he was assured by a high government
authority that his claim was original, valid, and
would eventually be allowed, thus giving him
the sole right to make airline express machines
for a limited period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps this action of the patent authorities
was hastened when an old army officer, a friend
of Tom’s father, heard about the matter and
declared such a machine would be of great
value to the United States in case of another
war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This officer impressed his views on certain
friends of his in the patent office, and the result
was that the usual leaden wheels in that institution
began to move more rapidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can wait long enough,” said General
Malcolm, who had been of such service to Tom,
“I believe I can even get you a government
subsidy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long would it take to get the government
to invest money in this new undertaking
of mine?” Tom wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, probably two or three years. A bill
would have to be introduced in Congress—it
might take four years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect to make the first flight inside of a
month,” Tom laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and his friends returned to Shopton,
and then followed many strenuous days and
nights of work for the young inventor. Those
who had faith in Tom and those who knew and
understood Ned Newton’s unusual knowledge
and judgment in financial matters so talked
to their friends that eventually outsiders put
one hundred thousand dollars into the scheme
and this, together with the money Mr. Damon
and other acquaintances subscribed and with
what Tom and his father had, gave them enough
cash to build three planes and two cars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Essentially there was nothing new or startling
in the construction of either of these machines.
My readers are all familiar with the general outline
of an aeroplane. Beneath the fuselage
which held the engine and a cockpit for the
pilot and his helper was built a heavy frame
to which could be clamped the passenger car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This car was like a Pullman parlor car combined
with a sleeper. It had some folding
berths and also some easy chairs. There was a
small dining room and a buffet kitchen, and
many conveniences were installed. Tom limited
the number of passengers to be carried on any
one trip to ten, saying he could enlarge the cars
if he found the machine was going to be a success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In due time the two cars and the three
planes received their last coats of varnish, the
powerful engines were installed after a rigid
block test, and one day Tom announced to Ned
that all was in readiness for a trial flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want to come along?” asked the young
inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” was the quick answer. “Anybody
else going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Mr. Damon is game and Father insists
on accompanying us. I think I’ll take Koku
along—he might come in handy in case anything
should happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was decided to make the start from the
big field outside of the Swift plant, and one
morning one of the planes and its accompanying
passenger car was rolled out on the level
stretch. To make the test under the same
conditions that would prevail when the airline
express was in service, Tom and his friends
entered the passenger car at one end of the
field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will imagine,” explained Tom, “that
we have just landed here from the plane that
brought us from Long Island to Chicago on the
first lap of the transcontinental flight. Now
we will run over and attach ourselves to the
other plane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As has been said, the passenger car could
move under its own power, as can an automobile.
Tom started the motor and skillfully guided the
car under the waiting aeroplane. In a moment
workmen had fastened the clamps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let her go!” Tom called to the pilot in
the aeroplane, and the big propellers began to
revolve with a thundering sound. The engine
seemed working perfectly and a moment later
the whole machine—the airline express—began
to roll forward across the field. There was a moment
of doubt as to whether or not the aeroplane
would raise itself and the heavy weight it had
to carry, but Tom had made his calculations
well, and, to his delight and that of his friends,
the machine began to soar upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurray!” cried Ned. “She’s doing it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we’re off on the first real flight, anyhow,”
agreed Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It works better than I expected,” Mr. Swift
said. All along he had been a bit skeptical
about this new scheme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later they were sailing over Lake
Carlopa and Mr. Damon, looking down from
one of the observations of the car, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t we flying a bit low, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think we are,” agreed the young
inventor. “Put her up a bit!” he signaled to
the pilot through the speaking tube.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back came the answer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t! Something has gone wrong! I’m
losing power! I’m afraid we’re in for a fall!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch16'>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>JASON JACKS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Just for a moment or two Tom Swift wished
he were in the motor cockpit of the plane instead
of in the passenger car with his father and
his friends. He had an idea he might so
manipulate the controls as to cause the falling
plane to increase speed and keep on flying until
a safe landing could be made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in an instant this idea passed. Tom
had full confidence in his mechanician, and
realized if Harry Meldrum could not prevent a
fall Tom himself could not, for Meldrum, taught
in the Swift school of flying, was a thoroughly
competent and resourceful airman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong?” Tom asked his engineer
through the tube.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oil pump has blown out a gasket! The
engine is heating. It’s got to stop soon and
we’ll have to come down—in the lake, I guess,”
was the grim finish of the report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve landed in worse places,” remarked
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anything going to happen?” his father
wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid there is,” the young inventor
answered. “We’re being forced down. I
thought everything was all right with the
machinery, but you never can tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my accident insurance policy! Do you
think we’ll go down right in the water, Tom?”
gasped Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It begins to look so,” was the reply. “But
perhaps better there than on land—there won’t
be such a shock. The plane has floating compartments,
and so has this car—I had them
built in as a precaution against water landings.
I don’t believe there will be any real danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no doubt about it—the plane was
gradually settling lower and lower—ever coming
nearer to the surface of Lake Carlopa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s slowing up, Tom,” remarked Ned, as
he listened to the throbs and pulsations of the
motor above them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’m afraid we’re in for it,” came the
response. “Can’t you make any emergency
repairs, Meldrum?” he asked the mechanician.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bert’s trying, but it doesn’t seem of much
use,” was the answer. Bert Dodge was the
assistant engineer, and fully as competent as
his chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This settles one thing,” remarked Tom, as
he glanced out of the car window. “On the
next flight I’ll have a duplicate oiling system
installed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brace yourselves, everybody! We’re in
for a ducking!” came the cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next moment the big new aeroplane and
its attached passenger car plunged into Lake
Carlopa with a mighty splash. For a moment
it seemed that they would be engulfed and all
drowned before they could make egress from
the plane and car. But Meldrum had guided
the machine down on a long angle so that the
water was struck a glancing blow. In effect, the
lower surface of the car and the tail of the plane
slid along the surface of the water for some
distance. This neutralized some of the force
of the impact, and then, though the machine
settled rather deeply in the water, it did not
sink. The air compartments prevented that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, help was at hand. A number of
motor boats were out on the lake, their occupants
watching the trial flight of the new airline
express. When it was known that an accident
had happened, these craft speeded to the
rescue. As soon as the boats drew near the
men in the plane and those in the car climbed
outside and thence were taken off in the boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks as if it was going to be a total loss,
Tom,” said Mr. Damon gloomily, as the craft
settled lower and lower in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s bad enough,” Tom admitted, ruefully
shaking his head, as the boat that had taken
him off circled about the <span class='it'>Falcon</span>, as Tom had
christened his first machine. “But even if she
sinks to the bottom I believe I can raise her.
The lake isn’t very deep here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, it was not quite as bad as that.
The <span class='it'>Falcon</span> was only partly submerged, and
there she lay, water-bound, in the lake. Her
actions decided Tom to install more air-tight
compartments and make the car lighter, which
would insure its floating higher in case of
another water drop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s nothing more we can do now,”
decided the young inventor. “If you’ll take
me ashore, please,” he said to his rescuer, “I’ll
make arrangements for getting the <span class='it'>Falcon</span> out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave orders to this effect as soon as he
reached his shop, and when Mr. Swift, with a
dubious shake of his head said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid this is a failure, Tom! It’s too
much for you.” The young inventor with a
determined air answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never given up anything yet, and I’m
not going to begin now! I see where I made
some mistakes and I’m going to correct them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the plane and the car were raised
and brought to shore—being found to have
suffered little damage—Tom started his reconstruction
work with more vim than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the accident, while it was not a
serious one from a mechanical standpoint, had a
bad effect on Ned’s campaign to raise funds
for putting the airline express into actual
service. True as it is that nothing succeeds like
success, nothing is more dampening to a money
campaign than failure. Capital seems very
timid in the face of failure, and deaf ears were
turned to Ned’s urgent appeal to the public to
buy stock. For while Tom was working on the
mechanical end, Ned looked after the business
interests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Ned, how goes it?” asked the young
inventor at the close of a hard day’s work when
Tom himself had been much cheered by the
progress he had made in lightening his passenger
car and installing a dual oiling system on the
plane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t go at all,” was the somewhat
gloomy answer. “People seem afraid to risk
their money. If you could only make a successful
flight, Tom, or get some millionaire to
invest about a hundred thousand dollars without
really seeing the thing fly, we’d be all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ll be more successful in the first
proposition than in the second,” replied Tom,
with a smile. “I don’t know many millionaires
who are letting go of dollars in hundred thousand
lots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fact, Tom, we’re almost at the end of our
financial rope. We’ve got just about enough
to complete the improvements you have begun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After that I’ll try another flight. If that
succeeds I think public confidence will be restored,”
returned Tom. “If we fall again—well——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll give up, I suppose,” finished Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all!” was the quick reply. “You’ll
find some other means of financing the thing.
This is going to succeed, Ned! I’m going to
make it! We’ll go from ocean to ocean by
daylight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom banged his fist down on his desk with
force enough to spill some ink out of the bottle,
and then, getting up from his chair, began putting
on his coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going—out to hunt for a kind
millionaire?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; that’s your end of the job. I’m going
for a ride with Mary,” was the smiling reply.
“I want to get some of the cobwebs out of my
brain. I can’t do any more now, and I promised
Mary I’d take her for a spin in the electric runabout.
It’s working all right, I suppose?”
he asked, for Ned had been using that speedy
machine in his financial campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it works well, Tom—faster than ever.
And I hope things will take a turn for the
better to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I. See you later,” and Tom was off
to keep his appointment with Mary Nestor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and Mary were riding along a quiet
country road back of a little village when Mary
observed just ahead of them an old man driving
a horse hitched to a light carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speaking of millionaires, Tom,” she said,
“there goes one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! Jason Jacks. He has several
millions, it’s said, but he holds on to them.
Father knows him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky boy!” exclaimed Tom. “I wish I
were you, J. J.!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t!” came promptly from Mary.
“If you were Jason Jacks, I wouldn’t be out
riding with you, Tom Swift!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” he demanded quizzically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he’s old, he hasn’t any teeth——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you don’t want to be bitten, do you?”
joked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not. But he’s got a mean
disposition, he’s homely——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks!” interrupted Tom, with a laugh.
“That’s an implied compliment, I take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take whatever you like,” laughed Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to take a few thousands from
Millionaire Jason Jacks,” retorted the young
man. “Still, if you feel that way about him,
Mary, I’m just as glad to be what I am,” and
Tom—well, it is affairs of no outsider what he
did just then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The look which passed between him and
Mary changed in a moment to a glance of alarm
as the girl pointed to the carriage ahead of
them and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom! I believe that horse is running
away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pretty near know it is!” was the answer,
as Tom began to speed up the electric runabout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Jacks will be thrown out,” went on
Mary. “He doesn’t seem to know how to
manage that animal! And there’s a dangerous
part of the road just ahead—it goes around a
curve and close to the edge of a cliff! Oh, Tom,
what are you going to do?”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch17'>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE AIRLINE STARTS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mary Nestor’s reason for putting her question
to the young inventor was because Tom was
speeding up the electric auto and guiding it
along the road in the direction of the runaway
horse. For that the animal was in a frenzy and
was now running away was apparent to both
the young people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do, Tom?” repeated
Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to save Mr. Jacks if I can before
he gets to the dangerous part of the road,”
answered the young inventor. “If I can run
up alongside of him, I may be able to lift him
out of his carriage in case there is a likelihood
of his going down the gully. Is the road very
narrow there, Mary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is—hardly wide enough for two
between the side of the cliff on the left and the
edge of the gully on the right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there’s not much chance of driving
the runabout between him and the edge of the
gully,” reasoned Tom. “I might go in myself.
Luckily he’s driving on the left side of his buggy
and this car has a right-hand drive. I can reach
right over and grab him. And when I get near
enough to do that, Mary, I want you to take the
steering wheel of this car and hold it steady.
Can you do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll try, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to do it if we’re to save his life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well then, Tom, I will,” returned Mary
in a quiet voice, and Tom knew she would not
fail him. “How fast the horse is going!” she
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light buggy whirled around a curve on
two wheels in a manner to make Mary catch her
breath. Tom gave a low whistle. Then as
the runabout made the same curve, Tom saw
that the road ahead was straight but narrow.
On one side, the left, rose a high cliff of rock,
and on the right hand was a deep gully, the
road running along its very edge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom, do you think you can catch him
in time?” asked Mary anxiously. “There’s
another curve, just ahead, and if the horse goes
around that as fast as it is going now it will go
over the edge and Mr. Jacks will be killed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to get him before that happens,”
declared Tom grimly. “The horse will never
be born that can beat my runabout.” Not idly
had Tom’s electric machine been called “the
speediest car on the road,” and now it surely was
speeding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the frantic horse did his best, it was
naught against the power of the batteries concealed
in Tom’s car, and in a few moments
the young inventor was driving along the
narrow road on even terms with the swaying
carriage in which sat a white-faced man. He
was sawing on the reins and trying by his voice
to halt the horse, but without effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The curve is just ahead, Tom,” warned
Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he answered. “You take the
wheel now. I’m going to stand up, reach over,
and pull him into this car. Keep close to the
face of the cliff—it’s our only chance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later Tom rose in his seat, and as
his hands left the steering wheel Mary leaned
over and took charge of guiding the car. Exerting
all his strength, Tom caught hold of Mr.
Jacks under the arms and fairly pulled him from
his seat. Luckily the old man was frail and
light, or Tom could not have done it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! Here!” cried the frightened horseman. “What—what——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the breath was fairly choked out of him as
Tom hauled him into the runabout and jammed
him down on the seat between Mary and himself.
Then Tom grabbed the wheel, and put on
the brakes with all his might, for the dangerous
curve was just ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On sped the maddened horse, the buggy
bouncing up off the uneven road. Just as the
runabout slowed to a stop the mad animal swung
around the curve. It did not make it, for its
speed was too great, and a moment later Mary
gave a cry of pity as the ill-fated brute shot over
the edge of the cliff, dragging the light buggy
with it. There was a rattle of gravel, a shower
of stones, a weird cry from the horse, which
must have sensed its doom, and then the end
came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the precipitous cliff had plunged the
animal, crashing to death on the rocks below
amid the splinters of the little carriage. Up
above on the road, close to the rocky face of the
cliff, sat the three in the runabout—a trembling,
aged man, a white-faced girl, and Tom Swift,
flushed by his exertions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—well,” stuttered Jason Jacks, when he
could get his breath, “I guess I’ve had a narrow
escape. My—my horse went over the cliff,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid he did,” answered Tom grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m just as glad,” went on the millionaire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Jacks!” exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! you know me, do you, young lady?
Well, the reason I said that is because if he’s that
kind of an animal, likely to run away without
warning on a dangerous road—as he did—I
don’t want ever to drive him again, and I
wouldn’t want anybody else to. I only bought
him the other day, and I’m glad I found out his
trick in time. But let me see—you know me.
Do I know you?” and he glanced sharply at the
now blushing girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you know my father, Mr. Jacks,” she
replied. “He is Mr. Nestor, and I have seen
you at our house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course! To be sure—Mary Nestor.
Well, I’m much obliged to you—and more
obliged to this young man for saving my life.
What’s your name?” he asked bluntly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom Swift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom Swift. Oh, yes, I’ve heard that name
before. You have a plant in Shopton, haven’t
you? You make motor boats and such things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have invented a few things,” Tom
modestly admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um—yes,” murmured the millionaire. “I’ve
heard of you. Well, I’m too much upset to
thank you properly now. Could you leave me
at my home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to,” answered Tom. “Do you want
to drive around the road at the bottom of the
cliff and find out about your horse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess there isn’t much left of him, young
man,” was the grim answer. “He’s had his last
run. It was a narrow escape for me. How did
you happen to be right on the spot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just by chance,” Tom replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drove back to the millionaire’s home, declining
an invitation to come in. Then Tom
and Mary went on, and when later in the evening
he left her at her home, she said with
shining eyes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom, suppose he should?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should what, Mary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give you ten or twenty thousand dollars for
saving his life? He could well afford to do it—he’d
never miss the money—and then you could
finish the new airline machines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want any reward for saving lives,
Mary. Besides, he’d have to give you a share.
If you hadn’t been with me I never could have
saved him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, Tom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No nonsense about it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the next day that Jason Jacks called
at Tom Swift’s office, driving up in a handsome
two-horse carriage with a footman in livery.
For the old millionaire was eccentric and liked
to imagine he was living in the old times. He
never could be induced to ride in an automobile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come to reward you, Tom Swift, for
saving my life,” began Mr. Jacks, taking out
his check book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, sir,” said Tom, firmly but in respectful
tones, “you can’t do anything of the
kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t do what?” Mr. Jacks asked sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reward me for saving your life. Any one
else would have done the same if he had had the
chance, and I would have done the same for
any one else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I suppose so,” slowly admitted Mr.
Jacks, and it was easy to see that Tom’s refusal
pleased him rather than otherwise. “Human
life can’t be bought, though I hold mine at a
high price. But look here, young man, since
you won’t accept a reward, will you let me do
you a favor in return for the one you did me?
That’s fair, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose it is,” admitted Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, I’ve been making inquiries about
you, and I hear you are trying to launch a new
invention. I don’t go in much for those things
myself—I have no use for aeroplanes, motor
boats, or automobiles, though I admit they have
their place in the world, and I own stock in
several motor companies. But I won’t ride in
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I hear you are contemplating an airline
express to San Francisco, but you haven’t
had much success with it so far. Am I right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” admitted Tom. “I have no hesitation
in saying I am a bit short of cash to complete
some improvements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then will you let me help finance the
thing?” asked Mr. Jacks. “Oh, on a strictly
business basis,” he added quickly, as he saw
Tom about to refuse. “I’ll buy stock the same
as I would in any other enterprise, and if it
succeeds I expect to be paid my profit, the same
as other investors. If it fails—well, it won’t be
the first time I have lost money, though I don’t
make a practice of that,” and he chuckled dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d be glad to sell you some stock,” said Tom
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right then, young man, we can do business.
I’ll have my secretary see you in a few
days. I don’t like to be under obligations to
anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither do I,” retorted Tom; “and I feel
sure that you will get a good return on what you
invest with me. I’m going to succeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you do half as cleverly as you did
when you pulled me out of that runaway, you’ll
win!” predicted Mr. Jacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later he invested fifteen thousand
dollars in Tom’s new enterprise, taking stock
to that value, and promising that if Tom could
make six successful trips each way, between
Long Island and the Golden Gate, carrying
passengers as arranged, he would invest one
hundred thousand dollars more and perhaps
even a larger sum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurray!” cried Tom when he heard this
news from Ned, who, of course, had attended
to the details of this matter. “Now our success
is assured!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m so glad!” exclaimed Mary, when he
told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Busy scenes were the order of the day and
night at the Swift plant after this much-needed
new capital was paid in. Tom kept his men
busy making improvements in the <span class='it'>Falcon</span>, and
at last the day arrived when a final test was to
be made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more Tom, Ned, Mr. Damon, Koku,
and some others took their places in the car.
Mr. Swift declined to come, saying it was too
much for his nerves. The car rolled over the
field, was clamped to the chassis of the big aeroplane,
and up in the air it rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time there was no accident, and off above
the lake and over the country soared the <span class='it'>Falcon</span>,
flying beautifully. “It’s a success!” cried Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to make a test landing and see how
long it takes to unclamp the car and fasten it
to the other plane,” said Tom, before he would
permit himself to exult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This test was successfully met, and up rose
the second plane, carrying the car, just as if the
scene had taken place on the field in Chicago,
the end of the first lap of the proposed airline
express.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not until then did Tom permit himself to
see visions of complete success. But after
another landing had been made and when the
car had been rolled to the third plane, it was
evident that the scheme could be carried out.
The third plane did not go up, not being quite
ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” Tom said to his friends when
they were talking it over, “this doesn’t mean
that we can make the time which I hope is
possible—sixteen hours from coast to coast—but
I’m going to make a big effort for those
figures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the next few weeks matters were rushed
to completion. A landing field was secured
on Long Island, another in Chicago, one on the
outskirts of Denver, and the last one at the
Golden Gate. The route was mapped out
with care, and guide posts and signal towers
were placed in position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, on a certain day, after many exhaustive
tests, it was decided to inaugurate the
first schedule of the airline express. The two
planes had been sent, one to Chicago and the
other to Denver, while the third was waiting on
the Long Island field, where the passenger car
had been taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Newspaper reporters, cameramen, moving
picture operators, and many spectators were
on hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All aboard!” cried Tom, as he gave the
signal to start. As he was about to close the
door of the car, which would soon be soaring
aloft, a boy ran across the field and thrust into
the hands of the young inventor a piece of
paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Message for you! Man gave me a dollar to
deliver it just as you started,” panted the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, before he could answer, though he had
an ominous feeling, Tom felt the car being lifted
off the ground. The airline express had started!</p>

<div><h1 id='ch18'>CHAPTER XVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CHICAGO</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Strange and mingled were the feelings
Tom Swift had as his great experiment was
started. There was exultation mingled with
apprehension. Exultation that he had at last
triumphed over many difficulties and the plots
of his enemies and had reached the point of
starting the service which might revolutionize
travel. Apprehension lest he might fail, and also
apprehension over this latest happening—the
giving to him of this note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had a sinister appearance—this hasty
message delivered in such a manner. It was in
keeping with some other things that had happened
of late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom’s chief concern now was to see that
his new craft got safely into the air and on its
way. He could deal later with those who sought
to steal from him the fruits of his labor and his
brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, overcoming his natural curiosity to see
what the note contained, Tom resolutely thrust
it into his pocket and gave his whole attention
to directing the management of the <span class='it'>Falcon</span>,
which was the plane and accompanying car
selected to hop off on the first leg of the transcontinental
trip. The other planes were named,
respectively, the <span class='it'>Eagle</span> and the <span class='it'>Osprey</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This last name was chosen by Tom as fitting
for the plane in which he hoped to ride when he
sighted the Pacific coast and ocean. For the
osprey is a fish-hawk, and Ned agreed with Tom
that it was a most appropriate name for a craft
in which they hoped to sight an ocean with its
millions of fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, together with Ned, Mr. Damon, and
some assistants, rode in the hanging car, while
in the cockpit of the aeroplane above them were
Harry Meldrum and Bert Dodge, the two able
mechanicians. Once he had seen for himself
how the car behaved, Tom intended to take his
shift in the cockpit, piloting the plane part of
the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had invited Mr. Jacks to make the first
trip, but the eccentric millionaire, whose money
had enabled the initial planes to be finished and
who had promised to invest a hundred thousand
dollars more in case Tom could successfully
complete six round trips, had smiled as he
shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of that for me!” he had answered.
“Runaway horses are dangerous enough, without
tempting fate in the shape of an aeroplane.
I wouldn’t go up for a million dollars, Tom.
But I wish you all success!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And success is what Tom hoped for as the
craft rose from the ground on this, its first
official trip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Tom, she’s moving!” exclaimed Ned,
as they rose higher and higher on a long slant
off the landing field and headed toward the
west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we got off in good shape,” agreed Tom,
as he noted various instruments and gages on the
walls of the car which indicated their speed
upward as well as forward and gave their height
above the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It certainly is fine,” asserted Mr. Damon.
“Bless my upper berth! it beats traveling in a
Pullman. And if you can do as you say, Tom,
and keep us in this car right through to the end
of the journey in San Francisco, it will be a
marvel. No change, nothing to worry about,
and traveling as clean as in a bath tub! It’s
great! Bless my toothbrush, it’s great!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t go so far as to say there was nothing
to worry about,” remarked Tom, with a
laugh, as he signaled to the mechanician for
more speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean—that letter the kid gave
you?” asked Ned, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I haven’t looked at that yet. Probably
it’s from some one who begged for a free ride,”
Tom answered. “But I mean the race isn’t
over until we have sighted the Golden Gate.
We’ve got to be there before dark to make a success
of this airline express, and we’ve got to travel
pretty fast—averaging two hundred miles an
hour for over fifteen hours. I hope we can do it,
but I haven’t given up worrying lest we fail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’ll do it all right!” declared
Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” added Ned, though, truth to tell, he
could understand and appreciate Tom’s feelings,
knowing, as he did, something of mechanics and
the slight defect in a piece of machinery that
might throw all calculations out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Falcon</span> was now rapidly gaining height
and speed, though, comfortably housed as they
were in the car, the occupants felt no unpleasant
sensations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If one has ever ridden in an aeroplane he
knows the swift, easy, gliding motion of the car.
It is like nothing on earth, for there is absolutely
no motion felt as in riding in an automobile or
motor boat. There are none of the bumps of
the roads, nor the swaying or rolling of water
travel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course there are “air pockets,” and when
these are encountered even the best airship may
take a sudden drop, which sensation is slightly
felt. And if one exposes one’s face or hands or
other part of the body to the rush of air, there
is a most distinct sensation felt. But the cowl
of the cockpit protects those in it from the
terrific rush of wind, the pressure of which
at two hundred and six miles an hour, is tremendous;
and of course those housed in the car
felt nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was like making a journey in a dream,
almost, and once the passengers were up above
the earth there was nothing by which their
progress could be gaged, as there is in a railroad
train, when telegraph poles, fence posts, and the
scenery seem to rush past at great speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So perfectly were the powerful motors running
that in a short time the gages showed that the
great speed of two hundred miles an hour
had been attained. But Tom wanted to do
better than this, especially on the first part of
the journey, between Long Island and Chicago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The more time we make on the start the less
we’ll have to worry about when we begin on the
third lap—over the mountains,” he said to Ned.
“I’ll go up into the cockpit myself soon. I
just want to see that everything is all right
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This did not take long. A full complement of
passengers was not carried on this initial trip,
and there was more than room for all of them
in the comfortable chairs. Koku had to be
content with a bench, for no ordinary chair was
large enough for him, and to his delight Eradicate
was allowed to take charge of the small
kitchen, where a buffet lunch would be served at
noon, and other refreshments as needed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah eben gib dat giant suffin in case he git hungry,”
chuckled Eradicate, who seemed to forget
his jealous enmity against the big man in his delight
at being near Tom and allowed to serve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After making a round of the car and seeing
that everything was well, Tom signaled up to
Meldrum that he was going to take charge of
the driving of the plane, asking Meldrum to
come down below. There was an enclosed companionway,
or ladder, by which the plane cockpit
could be reached through the roof of the
detachable car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hadn’t you better look at that note before
you go up?” suggested Ned, motioning to the
pocket in which Tom had put the letter the
boy had delivered to him at the last minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so—I almost forgot about it,” said
the young inventor, with a laugh. “But it’s
too late to answer it—we’re quite a way from
the starting point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was true. It had taken only a few
minutes for them to soar over New York City,
with its forest of tall buildings, then over the
Hudson, across Jersey City, and so out on the
long straight air line that led to Chicago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom pulled out the crumpled missive and
ripped open the envelope. As he read the few
lines a look of anger came over his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read it yourself,” Tom answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Ned scanned these lines:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out for yourself. You have started
but you haven’t finished. Our time is coming.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“The Masked Two.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of all the nerve!” cried Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t they!” said Tom. “But it will
take more than threats to make me give up this
project. I haven’t got my final patent papers,
but I will when I finish these trial trips. I
need to make only five more after this, and then
Jacks will put in a lot of money. It was lack
of ready money that was holding me back—once
I have plenty of cash I can snap my fingers
at those fellows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only five more trips,” murmured Ned.
“And this one hasn’t finished its first third,
Tom. But we’ll do it! The Masked Two can
go jump in the lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it!” exclaimed Tom. “I’m not
going to worry any more about it. Come on up
in the plane with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though Tom declared that he was not
going to worry over the matter, still he could
not altogether dismiss it from his mind. He had
left his aged father at home in charge of the
works, and though there were faithful men
around him and every safeguard that ingenuity
could devise, still those sinister enemies might
find some way of breaking through the cordon
and damaging the plant or injuring Mr. Swift.
So, in spite of his brave words, Tom worried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However, we’re in touch with them all the
while by wireless,” Ned remarked, as Meldrum
and Dodge descended when Tom had assumed
charge of the controls, with Ned to help him.
“You can always send and receive messages,
and so you’ll know when anything happens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed the young inventor. “I
almost forgot about that. I can keep in touch
with home that way. I’ll wireless back soon,
and see how everything is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Tom did after he had speeded up the
plane a little, once he found the motor was working
well after warming up. They were now
high in the air, hastening west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned sent off the message through the ether
waves. A powerful radio set had been installed,
and Tom could talk directly to his father, which
he was soon doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re making fast time, Dad,” he told him.
“How are things back there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Tom. You made a fine start. I
only hope you keep it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will. And look out for yourself. Our
enemies haven’t given up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be on the watch, Tom. Good-bye and
good luck!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For over four hours Tom and Ned, by turns,
with occasional relief from Meldrum and
Dodge, kept the motors running at top speed.
And it was not quite mid morning by the clock
when Ned, taking an observation, cried to his
friend:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Chicago below us, Tom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” exulted Tom Swift. “We’ll finish
the first leg a little ahead of time!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch19'>CHAPTER XIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>DENVER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, by his calculations and by computing
their rate of speed for the past five hours, was
already pretty sure in his own mind that they
would reach the City of the Lakes at least within
the time limit he had set for himself. But he
was, nevertheless, glad of Ned’s confirmation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now if they have everything in readiness at
the field, we won’t lose much time in detaching
this car from the <span class='it'>Falcon</span> and in hitching it on
to the <span class='it'>Eagle</span>,” Tom remarked to his chum as
he prepared to make the landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wouldn’t do any harm to wireless them
and make sure,” Ned suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you’re right. Go ahead and do it.
And, by crickity grasshoppers!” cried Tom, as
he looked at the gasoline and oil gages, “we’re
getting in just by the skin of our teeth, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How come?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got just about enough gas left to
make the field,” Tom said. “I didn’t realize
we’d used up quite so much. The engine was
cold when we started so early in the morning,
I guess, and it took more fuel to pep it up. I’ll
take along a bit extra on the next two legs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good idea,” suggested Ned, as he began
working the wireless instrument, to call the
operator at the Chicago landing field. He was
not long in getting him, for Tom had made his
arrangements well, and those associated with
him in the airline express were anxiously awaiting
his arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll land in about three minutes,” Ned
sent the message. “Is everything in readiness
for a quick change?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All O. K., sir,” was the reply, for a former
army flier was in charge here and he held to
the traditions of the service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better send word back to Dad,” went on
Tom, as he banked the plane slightly in readiness
for bringing it up into the wind to make
the landing on the big field just below them.
Off to the left was the glistening lake, and Tom
had a momentary glimpse of the wide and
beautiful Lake Shore Drive, Chicago’s principal
boulevard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you get him, Ned?” asked the young inventor,
as he noted below him the crowd that
had assembled to await his landing. Word of
the sensational attempt to link the two edges of
the United States by a dawn-to-dark flight had
been broadcasted all over the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, your father’s all right,” reported Ned,
who had been listening. “He sends his congratulations
and so does Mary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and anxious for your success,” reported
Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her I’ll talk to her after we hop off on the
other leg,” directed Tom, and then his attention
had to be given to making a safe landing—no easy
feat when it is remembered that he had no ordinary
aeroplane to bring down, but a heavy car
attached to it and passengers to look after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was successful, letting the <span class='it'>Falcon</span> gently
down to the ground with scarcely a perceptible
jolt, and then rolling gently along the even field
toward the place where the other plane was in
readiness, with motors slowly turning over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lively now!” cried Tom to the men who gathered
about him—trained workers from his own
shops who had been sent on ahead to make the
changes. “Every second counts, boys!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A curious crowd surged forward to see the daring
men who had set out to do their best to annihilate
time and space. The throng would have
overwhelmed the plane and its occupants, thus
preventing the quick shift of the car, but for the
fact that mounted police, whose aid Tom had enlisted,
kept the curious ones back a certain distance.
As it was, however, there was another
small army of movie cameramen, newspaper
photographers, and reporters on the scene, anxious
to get the news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you please stick your head out of the
window, Mr. Swift! Thanks. There! I got
you!” Thus spoke one of the newspaper cameramen.
Meanwhile others were clicking their
shutters while the movie men were industriously
grinding the cranks of their machines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were your sensations? Did anything
happen on the trip? Do you think you’ll make
the next leg on schedule?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were only samples of the scores of questions
that were fired at Tom by the newspaper reporters
as he sat in the car while it was being unclamped
from the first plane ready to run, under
its own power, to the other plane a short distance
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom answered as best he could, while Meldrum
piloted the car carefully through the mass of men
eager for information. They were the only ones
allowed to approach closely, for Tom well knew
the value of newspaper and movie news-reel
publicity. He wanted his venture to be well
known, since he needed much capital to put it on
a paying basis, and the more people who knew
about it the better chance he would stand of
getting capital into the venture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Tom, and Ned occasionally, answered all
the questions, gave a brief summary of the first
thousand miles of travel and told something of
their expectations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All ready?” called Tom anxiously, as he
looked at his watch. The change was taking a
little more time than he had counted on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All ready, sir!” came the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let go!” Tom called to his new mechanician
Sam Stone, who, with his helper, Jim Waldo, was
to do most of the driving on the second lap of the
journey. Of course Tom would take the wheel
now and then to relieve the pilot, who was, necessarily,
under a great strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The throttles were opened and the twin motors
responded with a thundering volume of explosions
which sent the <span class='it'>Eagle</span> across the field at ever increasing
speed, carrying the car and its passengers
with it. Then, like some great bird, true to her
name, the <span class='it'>Eagle</span> rose into the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chicago seemed to drop rapidly below the
passengers as the plane mounted higher and
higher, and her nose was pointed due west. Tom
took anxious observations of the various gages,
noted the increasing speed, and seemed well satisfied
until he scanned the weather reports which
one of his assistants handed him. They had
just come in from the government observatory in
Denver, and as Tom laid them back on the operator’s
table there was a worried look on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a report of storms ahead,” was the
answer. “But we may be able to go above them.
Strong head winds, the report says. They are
likely to delay us. But we won’t worry until we
have to. And now what do you say to something
to eat, Ned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m in favor of it,” was the answer. “We
had breakfast a bit early,” which was true
enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then tell Rad to serve up what he has,” directed
the young inventor to another colored man
who had been brought along to wait on the table,
since Eradicate insisted on doing the cooking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nothing new for Ned, Mr. Damon, and
Tom to eat while traveling at high speed far
above the earth. They had made many trips
in dirigible balloons and other craft, sometimes
remaining up almost a week at a time. But this
was the first occasion where so much depended on
long-continued speed, and the meal which was
soon served was more or less interrupted as Tom
left the table to ascertain what progress they were
making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the whole, it was satisfactory. As hour
after hour passed, the time being whiled away by
communicating back to Shopton now and again—Tom
holding his promised conversation with
Mary—it began to look as if the great project
would succeed. It was an hour after lunch when
Tom, peering down toward earth through a pair
of powerful binoculars, announced with exultation:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Denver!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On time, too!” exclaimed Ned. “Tom, we’re
going to make it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had just come down from the plane cockpit,
where Tom, with Ned’s help, had been guiding
the craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it looks as if we had two-thirds of our
journey behind us,” the young inventor was saying
when from the galley came the cry of Eradicate:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire! Fire! She’s on fire!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch20'>CHAPTER XX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A MOUNTAIN STORM</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift had to think of many matters when
he planned his airline express. He was aided,
however, by his past experience in manufacturing
aircraft and he had made many journeys above
the earth and had been in many kinds of peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not the least of these were fires, and Tom well
realized the danger of ignition in a craft necessarily
so frail as a flying machine heavier than air.
So in building the <span class='it'>Falcon</span>, the <span class='it'>Eagle</span>, and the
<span class='it'>Osprey</span> he had taken into consideration this menace
and had installed certain fire-fighting apparatus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order that this might be used to the best
advantage, Tom had instructed his men in a fire
drill, similar to that used on ships at sea when the
call to fire quarters is sounded at unexpected intervals
to accustom the passengers to acting
sanely in times of excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as Eradicated warning cry sounded forth,
Tom did not lose his head, but at once pulled the
level of the automatic signal which informed
those in the plane above, as well as those in the
car, that they must prepare to fight for their
lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put on the parachutes!” Tom cried, for
there was one of these life-savers for every person
on board. As you know, all the mail-plane fliers
now wear these “umbrellas,” as do all army fliers.
The parachute is made from a particular kind of
raw silk cloth. It can be folded into a very small
compass, and is strapped around a flier’s body
by means of leather belts going around his legs
and waist. On the waist belt is an iron ring, and
as the person jumps from a burning plane, or one
that is crippled and falling, this iron ring is pulled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately it releases the cords that hold the
parachute in folds and the silk spreads out in the
form of an immense umbrella. The air, getting
under this, acts as a brake, and the person comes
to the ground much more gently than otherwise
would be the case. Even with the parachutes,
however, there is danger in the fall, if it happens
to be in a tree, and often there is peril in falling
into the water. But, with all those, there is
much more chance for life than if none is used.
There is, too, always the danger that the parachute
will not open in time, but this happens so
rarely that it need not be considered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my door mat!” cried Mr. Damon,
fumbling with the straps. “I hope I don’t get
this thing on backward!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the way it goes!” cried Ned, who already
had his adjusted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, likewise, had adjusted his safety device,
and now the young inventor, thinking regretfully
meanwhile of this sudden ending of his hopes, began
to prepare for “abandoning ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here, Rad!” he called, for though the
colored man’s voice had issued from the galley
with the warning cry of fire, the man himself had
not appeared. “Hurry, Rad!” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later his old servant showed himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened, Rad?” cried Tom. “Quick!
Is the kitchen on fire? The automatic chemical
sprinkler ought to have worked!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Massa Tom,” answered the old colored
man. “De kitchen didn’t cotch fire—jes’ dis pie
whut I was makin’ fo’ yo’. I put her in de oven
ob de gaskoliny stove, and den I forgot it. ’Case
why? ’Case dat big giant got hungry an’ wanted
me to fix him up suffin to eat. An’ when I were
doin’ dat mah pie burned! Look, it’s laik a piece
ob charcoal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you mean to tell me, Rad, that you
raised an alarm of fire just because a pie burned?”
cried Tom, somewhat sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suah, I did,” was the answer. “Why not?
It was a fine pie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, bless my insurance policy!” exclaimed
Mr. Damon while the others stood listening,
hardly knowing whether to laugh or not. “You
sure did give us a scare, Rad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say so!” murmured Tom. “Whew,
but I’m glad it wasn’t true! It would have
meant the end of my hopes. Mr. Jacks wouldn’t
invest any more money if we burned up on the
second third of our trip. But are you sure everything’s
all right, Rad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Massa Tom, eberyt’ing but dish yeah
pie!” and ruefully the old colored fellow held out
the remains of the pastry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m glad it was no worse,” replied the
young inventor. “I guess we can take these off,”
he went on, as he began loosening his parachute
belt. The others did likewise, and then word was
relayed to the mechanicians in the plane above
that all was well and that there was no need to
leap out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then we’ll descend on Denver in the way
we originally intended,” decided Tom, for they
were now over that interesting and historic city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same scenes were enacted here as had taken
place in Chicago. A big crowd was on hand to
welcome and cheer Tom Swift and his comrades,
and the natural western exuberance of the people
was a little too much for the police. Tom
had difficulty in piloting the unclamped car
through the mass of curious ones to the waiting
<span class='it'>Osprey</span>, the propellers of which were slowly whirring
in anticipation of the flight to the Pacific
coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after answering many questions of the reporters
and posing for his photograph and for the
movie men, Tom at last was in the car beneath
the third aeroplane. It was now well on in the
afternoon, and if the originator of the airline express
hoped to do the entire distance in sixteen
hours it behooved him to “get a hustle on,” as
Ned expressed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hardest part of the trip is ahead of us,
Tom,” his manager said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it is,” was the answer. “Over the
Rockies. But the predicted storm hasn’t come
to the scratch, and I’m glad of that. It means
quite a gain in time not to run into bad weather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better wait before you crow,” said Ned.
“We have about six hours of riding ahead of us,
and there’s no telling what we may meet with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was glad to note, by inspections of the
various gages, that the <span class='it'>Osprey</span> was doing better
in regard to speed than either the <span class='it'>Falcon</span> or the
<span class='it'>Eagle</span>. She fairly roared and soared her way into
the air after leaving Denver, carrying aloft, in
the car beneath her, the young inventor and his
friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom got the wireless apparatus to working and
after some difficulty succeeded in establishing
communication with his home, where he talked
to Mrs. Baggert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father is lying down, taking a nap,” reported
the housekeeper. “Yes, he’s all right.
But a queer message came in over the local office
telephone a little while ago, Tom. Wait, I’ll
repeat it to you. I answered, because no one else
was around, and I heard a voice saying: ‘Tell
Tom Swift not to count his chickens before
they’re hatched!’ And then a man’s voice
laughed. I tried to find out who it was and where
the message came from, but I couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, don’t worry about it,” Tom advised
Mrs. Baggert, though he himself felt not a little
anxious. “They’re still up to their old tricks,
Ned,” Tom reported to his financial manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they can’t get at us while we’re up
here,” Ned answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but we aren’t at San Francisco yet, and
something may happen there,” Tom replied.
“I do hope they won’t make any more trouble for
Dad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will be well looked after by Mrs. Baggert
and the others,” was Ned’s consoling reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On and on roared the <span class='it'>Osprey</span>, like the great
hawk whose name she bore, winging her way toward
the great open space of the Pacific. The
hours rolled around, and they were crossing a wild
and desolate rocky region when suddenly the
comparative stillness was broken by a loud,
booming sound, as if of an explosion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” exclaimed Ned, and Tom, who
was making a log record of the trip, looked up apprehensively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thunder!” answered Mr. Damon, who was
sitting near one of the observation windows.
“I just saw a flash of lightning. I guess we’re
running into a storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no doubt of it a few moments later.
With the <span class='it'>Osprey</span> rushing forward and the mountain
storm coming to meet the craft, it was only
a short time before the airline express was in the
midst of a violent outburst of the elements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew, this is fierce!” cried Tom, as there
came a blinding flash, followed by a terrific clap,
and then, almost immediately after, by a shower
of rain as if a cloud had burst above them.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch21'>CHAPTER XXI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE GOLDEN GATE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Caught in the very center of a fierce mountain
storm, the <span class='it'>Osprey</span> was now battling her way above
the jagged and towering peaks of the Rockies,
fighting for every inch in an endeavor to reach
San Francisco within the stipulated time.
Though by the clock there were several hours of
daylight still remaining, it was so dark and
gloomy in the stormy mountain region that it
seemed as if night had fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we may pull out of it yet!” cried Tom
to his friends, as he saw to it that all the openings
of the traveling car were tightly closed. For
once the air, under high pressure because of the
velocity of the wind, gained an entrance, it might
do serious damage. But Tom had foreseen that
they might run into storms, and had so built his
car that a few pulls on certain levers would close
everything save the protected ventilators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through these fresh air came in and the foul
air was expelled, but rain could not enter. It
was different in the aeroplane above the car, however.
There the mechanician and his assistant
were pretty much in the open, though there was
a cowl of heavy celluloid to protect their faces
and Tom had rigged up an extra hood to keep off
some of the rain and snow that might be encountered
on the trip. But from the very nature
of their calling, aeroplane pilots must fly with
much of their bodies exposed to the elements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they expect to go to great heights and
encounter cold of such intensity that it is hard to
conceive of it, they wear suits in which are woven
wires of high resistance. A low voltage electric
current, passing through these wires, warms
them, just as is done in some of the warming
pads used in bed by invalids. In this way the
blood of the daring aviators is kept circulating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as Tom did not expect to go very high on
his airline express trips, there was no need of these
electrically heated suits, and none had been taken
along. However, he had taken into consideration
that they might run into rain, and rubber
coats had been provided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go up and relieve Ted Dolan,” remarked
Tom to Ned, for the third crew of pilots had
been taken on at Denver to make the final hop
to the Pacific coast. Dolan was an experienced
airman and had for his helper Art Wright. But
they had not taken their rubber coats up in the
cockpit with them, for when they left Denver
the weather was all that could be desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go with you,” offered Ned. “I’d like to
see just how bad this storm is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a humdinger all right,” declared Tom,
as he glanced out of an observation window while
waiting for Eradicate to bring the storm garments
from a locker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my nose-guard, I’ll say it is!” chimed
in Mr. Damon. “I never saw a worse one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’ve been in just as severe ones before,”
observed Tom, in what seemed a cool voice.
“When we were trying out the flying boat I
remember a storm when I thought we never
would get through it. This is bad enough, but
the <span class='it'>Osprey</span> can buck it I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah knows Massa Tom gwine to pull us
through all right,” said Eradicate, with a glance
at Koku. “Ah isn’t scairt, no how!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh! Black man talk big—but him knees
shake all same,” sneered the giant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose knees am shakin’, big man? Whose
knees am shakin’?” demanded the colored servant,
as he strode toward the big fellow. It
seemed as if he might try to punch Koku.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do,” commanded Tom in a low
voice. He had troubles enough on hand without
a fight starting between his two helpers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A signal was given for Wright to descend to
the cabin, and when he came down Tom went
up through the enclosed ladder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it bad up there?” he asked his workman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad?” was the reply. “Say, you ought to
feel it!” He was wet through—as dripping as
though he had fallen into a tub of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Tom took charge of the cockpit Dolan
descended, glad enough to get out of the way of
the stinging pellets of rain, driven by the hurricane
wind. He, too, was soaked. Ned followed
his chum up into the cockpit, and, though
they were protected by goggles, helmets of
leather, and rubber coats, they felt the force of
the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What with the roaring of the motors, the howl
of the wind, the crash of thunder, and the rattle
of the rain, it was impossible for the two to communicate,
even though they had speaking tubes
running from the forward cockpit to the one
built aft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young inventor, who had taken personal
charge of piloting the big plane through the
storm, that it might arrive on time, soon realized
that he had his “work cut out for him,” as he
said later. While it is not at all unusual for
aeroplanes of even less power than the big ones
Tom used to fly through storms, still there is
always the element of danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom’s <span class='it'>Osprey</span> had one advantage. Because
of the heavy car slung below it, the center
of gravity was thus made much lower than usual,
and this served to keep the craft steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom glanced at the oil gage, at the gasoline
indicator, and at the needle of the dial which
showed their height above the ground. He had
noted the tips of several jagged peaks below as
they flew over them, and he realized that while
they might be up sufficiently high in flying over
level ground, they were not when traversing
the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little drop and we’ll scrape some of those
stone teeth,” thought Tom. “I’m going up a
bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in much more comfortable circumstances
than had been the two men whom he
and Ned relieved, for the storm garments protected
him and his chum. Consequently Tom
could give more undivided attention to managing
the craft. His first act was to increase the
speed of the motor and tilt the elevating rudder
to send them higher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s going to try to rise above the storm,”
decided Ned, though this was not actually
Tom’s idea. He merely wanted to be a little
farther above those towering mountain peaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Osprey</span> responded well, and soon they had
lost sight of the jagged “teeth,” as Tom called
them. But the storm was not to be cheated
in this way, and still raged around them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why doesn’t he go higher?” thought Ned.
“He’s often flown at a greater elevation than
this and in bigger machines. Once he’s above
the clouds he’ll be out of the storm and into sunshine,”
for the sun was still above the horizon,
though invisible to the travelers on account of
the masses of storm vapor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Tom did not want to take too many
chances. He felt that his craft was doing quite
well as it was, forging ahead, though at some
loss of speed, and if he could keep her there he
would make the journey safely, though he began
to figure now on losing an hour or two from his
schedule of sixteen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a time the storm seemed to abate a little,
and they were congratulating themselves that
they had ridden through it, when, all at once,
it burst over them with redoubled fury. So
powerful was the wind that once or twice the
<span class='it'>Osprey</span> seemed actually to stand still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course that might not really have been the
case. Wind seldom obtains a velocity of more
than a hundred miles an hour, even in the worst
storms, and Tom’s craft was keyed up now to do
at least two hundred miles, which was double
that of the wind. But it may well have been
that her speed was cut down by half, and from
what developed afterward Tom was inclined to
think this was the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with a fierceness of spirit that equaled the
fierceness of the storm, Tom drove his machine
on. He was determined to finish this first trip
at least pretty nearly on schedule. It would
mean a wonderful amount of prestige for him if
he could, and almost insure the success of the
undertaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though at one time, during a terrific outburst
of wind, lightning, and rain, it seemed as if they
would be utterly overwhelmed, Tom was skillful,
and brought the <span class='it'>Osprey</span> around and straightened
her out of a dangerous side slip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, almost as suddenly as the storm had begun,
it stopped. The machine slid out of the
region of wild disturbance into daylight. Ned,
peering past Tom, looked ahead. He saw something
that caused him to cry:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Golden Gate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” shouted back Tom, “that’s San
Francisco just ahead of us. But we’ve lost
about two hours!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch22'>CHAPTER XXII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>KENNY BREAKS DOWN</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The quiet following the storm came as a great
relief to Tom and Ned, alone up there in the
cockpit of the plane. Though their friends were
within a few feet of them, they really seemed
quite isolated, for they could neither see nor
hear the others in the car below them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m glad we’re out of that,” remarked
Tom, with a long breath—the first, seemingly,
that he had taken in some time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same here!” commented Ned. They were
able to converse now by means of the speaking
tube which connected the forward and aft cockpits,
having only to overcome the roar of the
motors and not the fierce rattle of the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I guess if we do it inside of nineteen
hours we’ve accomplished a lot,” went on Tom.
“The Broadway Limited thinks it’s doing wonders
if it goes from New York to Chicago in
eighteen, but we have them skinned by several
miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it!” cried Ned, with justified enthusiasm.
“But do you think you’ll lose all
of two hours, Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fully that,” Tom admitted, rather ruefully.
“I did hope we might make it in sixteen hours
and a few minutes, as I said we could do. But
that storm actually cut two hours, if not more,
off our schedule. However, it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So rapidly was the <span class='it'>Osprey</span> making time now
that it seemed as if the Golden Gate were rushing
forward and opening wide to receive the
wonderful craft and her occupants. It is the
sun, setting in a glory of gold outside the harbor
of San Francisco that gives the poetical name to
the city, as much so, perhaps, as the yellow nuggets
it produced in the days that never will return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a signal from the car. It was
Ted Dolan calling up to Tom:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want to be relieved?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, no,” the young inventor answered.
“I’ll stick now and make the landing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you might want to do so,” Ted
said. “But if the storm played you out, Art
and I will take her for a little while and you and
Mr. Newton can come up again just before
making the landing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’ll stick,” announced Tom. “How
about you?” he asked his chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m game, of course. I wouldn’t miss it for
anything. They ought to reward you publicly
in some way, Tom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reward! What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For establishing this airline express—crossing
the United States in the daylight hours of a
single day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reward nothing! If I can do it, the only
reward I want is for Jason Jacks and others who
can afford it to invest money in the project and
get it firmly established.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they’ll do that all right, Tom. Is that
the landing field below us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned pointed to a green level stretch outside
the city of San Francisco. They had approached
it rapidly, for the <span class='it'>Osprey</span>, as if determining to live
up to her name, was fairly zooming toward the
Pacific.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it,” was the answer. “There’s quite
a crowd there, too! Hope I don’t muss anybody’s
hair as I go down. Confound the people!
Why don’t they know enough to keep out
of the way when they see an aeroplane coming
down right among ’em?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well might Tom ask this, for the crowd, which
had assembled in anticipation of seeing the
landing, was swarming all over the field in spite
of the efforts of the police to keep a free place
for the machine to come down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give ’em a bit of a scare,” decided Tom.
Quickly shifting the rudder of his plane, it appeared
for a moment as if he was going to crash
down where the crowd was thickest. With yells
of alarm the people scattered, and this left a
clear space, which was what Tom wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now for a landing, Ned!” he called to his
chum. “Mark the time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mark it is!” answered Ned, who sat with
his watch in one hand and a pencil in the other,
ready to make the record on the official slip of
paper he held on his knee. “It’s over eighteen
hours, though, Tom,” he said regretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid it is, Ned. But it can’t be helped.
Better luck next time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hope so,” was the response.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later, amid the wild and enthusiastic
cheers of the crowd, Tom brought the <span class='it'>Osprey</span>
to earth, the first time she had touched it since
leaving Denver. The car landed with a gentle
thud, rolled along a little way and then came to
a stop while the crowd of reporters, cameramen,
and general curiosity seekers rushed forward in
an overwhelming wave. It was a reproduction
of the same scenes that had taken place in
Chicago and Denver, only this was more intensified,
for it marked the end of the journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before Tom would reply to the score of
questions hurled at him by the reporters he
called to Ned:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What time do you make it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manager figured rapidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eighteen hours and sixteen minutes from
Long Island to San Francisco,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so bad,” murmured Tom. “But we’re
going to do better than that the next time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, as he stepped down from the plane,
he was surrounded by an excited and curious
crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us about it! What was the exact running
time? Did you have any accidents?
How do you feel? When are you going to make
the return trip?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These, and dozens of other questions, were
fairly volleyed at Tom by the newspaper men,
and he answered as best he could. By this time
he was used to the printed publicity that followed
his work, and he knew the value of it.
So he was always courteous and kind to the reporters
and photographers, patiently posing
for the latter and letting them take as many
pictures as they wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a great feat, and every one realized
that. As soon as enterprising reporters had
telephoned the facts in to their papers in San
Francisco, whistles were blown and bells were
rung to celebrate the event. Tom was a popular
hero, much as he disliked the role.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of his arrival was flashed back over
land wires and by means of radio to New York
and the East, though Tom did not wait for
Mary and his father to receive the good news in
this indirect way. As soon as he had given the
reporters the gist of the story, speaking of the
terrible storm through which they had run,
Tom had his operator get in touch with his home
on the radio. In a short time Tom’s voice was
heard in the house at Shopton where Mary, her
father and mother, and Mr. Swift had been sitting,
anxiously waiting. It was night there,
though still daylight in San Francisco.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right, Dad!” reported the young inventor.
“Didn’t make it quite as speedily as I
hoped, but I’ll do better on the return trip.
How’s Mary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s all right,” answered Mr. Swift. “She
will speak to you in a moment. But, Tom, be
careful. I’m worried about you. A number of
mysterious messages have come in over the
telephone wires during the day. I’m afraid your
enemies are still on your trail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, maybe they are, Dad, but I think I
have given them the slip,” laughed Tom.
“Anyhow, they couldn’t stop me from making
this one trip. And now let me talk to Mary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were soon in conversation and the girl
was greatly relieved to learn that Tom and his
friends were safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do be careful, won’t you?” she begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sure will!” Tom promised. “Don’t
worry! I haven’t seen any of those fellows out
here. Guess it was too far for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was soon to learn, however, that this was
not the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bidding Mary good-bye over the radio and
promising to talk to her again as soon as he
could, Tom shut off the power on the wireless
and made preparations for having his machine
guarded during the night. Except for some of
the mechanicians who would sleep on board, the
others were to go to a hotel. There they would
get some much-needed rest and prepare to make
the return trip in a few days. Tom wanted
time, however, to have the engines carefully
gone over. Also he wanted to communicate
with the crews in Denver and Chicago and have
them alert and ready to speed him on his way
when the return trip should be made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hasty inspection of the <span class='it'>Osprey</span> showed that
the plane had sustained no damage in flying
through the storm, but could, after a few adjustments,
make the return journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you say to a good bath, Ned,
and a lobster supper?” asked Tom of his chum,
when they had summoned an automobile which
would take them and Mr. Damon, with Eradicate,
to the hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds good to me,” Ned answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Koku he stay and guard machine,” announced
the big giant proudly, for Tom had informed
him that was to be his duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let anybody near it,” cautioned his
master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anybody come—Koku make ’um all full
holes,” was the grim answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mebby Ah better stay, too,” suggested
Eradicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I want you with me, Rad,” Tom said.
“I need looking after and so does Ned. We
brought only one suit of clothes each, and they
need pressing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat’s whut I’ll do!” said the old colored
man. He was pleased thus to serve his master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So great was the interest manifested by the
papers in Tom’s exploit that he could hardly
get away from the reporters long enough to eat.
At last he had fairly to beg them to give him a
few minutes of quiet, and reluctantly they consented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after he had bathed and dined they were
at him again, so it was long past midnight when
Tom was really free. Mr. Damon, tired with
the unusual trip, had retired, and thus Tom and
his financial manager found themselves left
pretty much alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t feel a bit like sleeping,” Tom said,
“I’d only toss and tumble if I went to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same here,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you say if we take a run out to the
plane?” asked Tom. “I’d like to make sure
she’s all right, even with Koku and the others on
guard. There’s altogether too much curiosity
about her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m with you—come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A taxicab took them out to the landing field,
but, being a new man, the driver made a wrong
approach and found himself on a blind road,
half a mile from the <span class='it'>Osprey’s</span> landing place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” said Tom, when the man
offered to go back and approach by the proper
route. “We can make better time by walking
across lots. This will do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom paid and dismissed the driver and then
he and Ned made their way through the darkness,
somewhat illuminated by the moon, toward
the place where the craft rested. Their approach
was unnoticed, which was beginning to make
Tom think that perhaps Koku was not as active
on guard duty as he might have been, when suddenly
from the bushes just ahead of them a man
sprang. He started to run away, but Ned,
sensing something suspicious in his movements,
sprang forward and caught hold of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you?” cried the young financial
manager. “What have you been doing? Show
a light here, Tom,” for Ned knew his chum carried
a pocket flashlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the gleam was thrown on the man’s
face Tom cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kenny! You here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, to the surprise of Tom and Ned, the
fellow broke down and actually began to whimper
as if his spirit was broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I give up, Mr. Swift!” he exclaimed. “I
can’t fight against you! It’s too big a thing
you’ve done. Nobody else could have done it.
I’m through with those fellows! But look out—they’ll
ruin you if they get the chance. Now
have me arrested if you want to—I’m done!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood there, making no effort to escape,
a broken, dejected man.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch23'>CHAPTER XXIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ANOTHER CAPTURE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Swift could not understand this attitude
on the part of Kenny. The fellow had been one
of the four (including the two mysterious masked
men) who had captured Tom in the tunnel and
had held him a prisoner on the island in the lake.
Kenny had seemed as relentless and vicious as
any of the four who were intent on getting away
from Tom his patent on the airline express.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, after an easy capture, Kenny had
broken down—given up—and professed to be
sorry. It did not seem natural. No wonder
Tom and Ned were on their guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were you doing back there at the
plane, if that’s where you were?” demanded
Tom, while Ned held the prisoner fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I was near your plane, but I didn’t do
any damage—I—I just couldn’t,” Kenny faltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you going to do any damage?” Tom
inquired sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was—if I could—yes,” was the reply.
“They wanted me to blow it up or damage it in
some way, so you couldn’t make the return trip.
But I hadn’t the heart to do it—I just couldn’t
bring myself to it, Mr. Swift—I just couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who do you mean wanted you to blow
up my machine?” asked the young inventor.
“Was it Schlump and those two masked men?
Who are they, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it was them. But I can’t tell you who
those other two are,” was the reply. “It would
mean death to me if I squealed. But I’m
through. Do what you like with me, only don’t
let those fellows get hold of me. I’m done for
if you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know but what you aren’t done
for now?” asked Ned grimly. “We’ve got you
fast, and your confession is enough to send you to
jail. Kidnapping is a serious crime, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind going to jail,” whimpered
Kenny. “That would be better than being
killed—never knowing when the blow was going
to fall. If I’m in jail they can’t get me. And
they’ll try to, for they’ll soon know I didn’t
carry out my end of the bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re going to jail all right!” declared
Tom. “It may be the best and safest
place for you, and I surely will feel better when
you’re behind bars. But what’s the game, anyhow?
Why should Schlump and those two
masked men want to do me harm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell you,” Kenny faltered. “I have
betrayed them enough as it is, and I’m not going
to say any more. I give up—that’s enough for
you—and I warn you to look out. Now all I
want is protection from them. Have me locked
up; I deserve it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Tom and Ned had decided at once to do.
But they were still suspicious over Kenny’s sudden
breakdown after his capture. That might
be a plot to throw them off the track, to enable
the other plotters to get in their work. Tom resolved
to be on his guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Koku and some of the others in the plane car
had come out on hearing voices, and in a few
words the young inventor explained what had
happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I keep him,” said Koku significantly, as he
took hold of Kenny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let him kill me!” pleaded the prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t hurt you—that is, if you don’t
try to get away,” said Tom grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to. I’m through, I tell you.
Why, if I had wanted to I could have blown you
to pieces half an hour ago. Go over there and
look!” he exclaimed, pointing to a spot near some
empty boxes and cases, that had contained materials
used in preparing the landing field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take a look, Ned,” suggested Tom, handing
his chum the flashlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes Ned came back bearing an
object, at the sight of which some of the workmen
cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a bomb! Look out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The firing apparatus has been taken out—here
it is,” said Kenny, and he took something
from his pocket. “It can’t go off the way it is,”
he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A quick inspection on the part of Tom proved
the truth of this. A bomb had been concealed
in the rubbish, and, had it gone off, it very likely
would have wrecked the <span class='it'>Osprey</span>, and, possibly,
have injured or killed those in the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I couldn’t do it,” confessed Kenny. “I
had it all ready to plant and was going to set
the time fuse when I weakened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you do that?” asked Tom, still
suspicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To tell you the truth, it was because I
couldn’t bear to wreck such a fine machine as
you have made,” Kenny admitted, and there
was a bit of pride in his voice and look. “I’m a
good mechanic,” he went on. “You found that
out in the shop before I was discharged, didn’t
you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you were an expert in your line,” admitted
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I got in bad company—maybe that’s
how you can account for it,” proceeded Kenny.
“I’m not defending myself—but I got in wrong
and bad. You did right to fire me—but then I
wanted my revenge. I was in the crowd that
saw you come down to-day,” he told Tom.
“The gang sent me on here to finish the job
which they couldn’t do in Shopton because you
were too well guarded. They figured it would
be easier here, and it was. I didn’t have much
trouble hiding that bomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when I saw you come sailing in and
knew you had almost done the journey as you
said you’d do it—in sixteen hours—I just didn’t
have the heart to destroy the machine. It
would be like a man running his pet auto into a
stone wall deliberately. I didn’t have the heart.
You needn’t believe me, but that’s the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do believe you—in that, at least,” Tom
said. Being a mechanic himself he could understand
another workman’s love for a wonderful
piece of machinery. “But that doesn’t let you
out, Kenny,” said Tom sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it doesn’t, Mr. Swift. I’m not
asking to be let off. I’m better in jail as it is.
I don’t want those fellows to get me, for they’ll
know I double-crossed ’em. Lock me up—that’s
all I ask. I’m down and out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He really seemed so, and was as honest as he
could be under the circumstances. Strange as
it may appear, his love for machinery in the abstract,
his delight in a perfect piece of work, had
overcome his promise to his confederates. Tom
believed this much of his story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The police were notified and Kenny was taken
to jail, on the technical charge, in lieu of another,
of unlawfully possessing explosives. For the
time fuse found on him contained a charge heavy
enough in itself to have done considerable damage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s one out of the way,” commented
Tom to Ned after Kenny had been taken off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But there are three left, according to
his talk, and maybe more,” said the manager.
“What are you going to do about them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to carry on—fly back to New York
Tuesday,” was the answer. “But at the same
time I’ll be on the watch. It is hardly possible
that any more of the gang are out here. They
depended on Kenny, and he double-crossed
them, to our advantage. And they won’t have
time to start anything at Denver or Chicago—they
can’t get there in time. They’ll know, of
course, by watching the papers, that nothing
happened to us here. They can argue either
that Kenny failed or threw them down—it
doesn’t matter which they decide on. But
their next move will be made at the Long Island
field—if they move at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, thinking it over, Ned came to the same
conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly preparations were made for the
return trip of the <span class='it'>Osprey</span> to Denver where the
<span class='it'>Eagle</span> would pick up the car and carry it to
Chicago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were enthusiastic scenes as Tom hopped
off early Tuesday morning, when it was hardly
daylight. He had sent a message the night
before to Mary and his father, telling them of
the start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom’s trip back to the East was even more
successful than his trip out, and he made better
flying time by the hour, for no storm was encountered.
The same wild scenes of greeting
when he landed in Denver and Chicago were
witnessed again, and word of his progress was
flashed by wireless and telegraph as he passed
over city after city on his way home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In due time he reached the landing field in
Long Island and received a roaring welcome.
The first round trip had been made successfully,
and but five more remained to be made before
the rich Mr. Jacks would put in enough money
to insure the financial success of the new enterprise.
And once it became known that Jacks
had invested others would do the same, Tom
reasoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was with a feeling of pride and satisfaction
that Tom went back to Shopton to tell his
father and Mary all the details. He decided to
let a week elapse before trying another journey,
as there were some mechanical changes he wanted
to make in the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the second round trip, the time
being cut down a little, but not enough to satisfy
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the third one he was so long delayed by a
storm that his time was a half hour more than on
his first trip west. However, he was still within
the daylight stipulation, and Mr. Jacks announced
himself satisfied thus far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three more round trips, and I’ll come in on
a big scale,” said the old millionaire. “It begins
to look feasible, Tom Swift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is feasible, Mr. Jacks,” was the answer.
“You’ll see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the millionaire came very near not
“seeing,” for the night before the sixth round
trip was to start something ominous happened
out at the Long Island hangar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and his friends had gone to a hotel there,
to be in readiness for an early morning start.
The young inventor had inspected the machinery
and found everything in perfect order.
Koku and Eradicate had been left on guard,
their differences for a time being patched up.
Each one was proud of his part in the night’s
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was shortly after midnight when Eradicate,
carefully marching around his end of the plane,
thought he detected a movement in the bushes.
The old man’s eyesight was none of the best,
much as he disliked to admit this, but he decided
he would do better to summon Koku, which he
did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe dere’s somebody ober dere, big man,”
whispered Eradicate, pointing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant was like a cat—he could see in the
dark. For a moment he bent his gaze on the
bush indicated by the colored man. Then with
a roar of anger the big fellow rushed forward,
jumped into the shrubbery and came out, dragging
after him a struggling man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go! Let me go!” cried this individual.
He tried to get something out of his
pocket, but Koku held his hand until other
watchmen came with lights, and then it was seen
that the prisoner was Schlump. An ugly sight
he was, too, his face inflamed with rage. Koku
pulled his hand from the pocket and found that
Schlump was clutching a deadly bomb with a
time fuse which shortly would have set it off.
But some of the mechanics soon rendered the
infernal machine harmless, and Schlump was
taken before Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, we’ve caught you, have we?” asked the
young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it seems!” Schlump snarled. “But
you’d better try to save yourself! The others
are still after you! I’m not the only one! And
you haven’t got me yet—not quite!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an unexpected and quick motion he
broke away from Koku and ran off in the darkness.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch24'>CHAPTER XXIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>TROUBLES AND WORRIES</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly the scene just outside the hangar
where the plane and the car were kept was in
confusion. So quickly had Schlump given his
captor the slip that, for a moment, every one
was stunned. Even Tom Swift, accustomed as
he was to emergencies, did not know what to do.
But this hesitation was only momentary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get him!” shouted the young inventor.
“We’ve got to get him! Scatter and round
him up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn on the searchlight!” yelled Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By golly!” chuckled Eradicate, who had
seen the man get away from the giant, “dat big
man ain’t so smart whut he t’ink he am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that now, Rad!” ordered Tom,
a bit sternly. “Forget your fights with Koku
and see if you can find this fellow! We want to
question him and see if we can’t get on the trail
of the masked men and others who are trying to
queer my plans!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sah,” humbly answered the colored
man. “I’ll cotch him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this was more easily said than done.
Though the big searchlight was flashed on, its
beams crossing and recrossing the field about the
hangar like a giant’s finger, the plotter was not
picked up. The chances were greatly in his
favor, running off in the darkness as he had, and
after an hour’s search it became evident that he
was not to be caught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back,” Tom advised his friends and
the workmen. “We’ll have to let him go,” he
added, as they made their way back to their
temporary headquarters. “We got the bomb
away from him, and we’ll take care that he
doesn’t approach near enough the remainder of
the night to plant another. We’ll have to
organize a patrol, Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess that’s right,” assented the financial
manager. “We can’t take any chances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reluctantly Koku gave up the search, for he
felt it was his fault that Schlump had escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nex’ time I sot on him!” declared the giant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be like a pancake when you get up,”
chuckled Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the night every precaution was
taken to prevent any damage being done to the
plane or the car. Men walked about the hangar
in relays, and the slightest suspicious object or
movement was at once investigated. Nothing
happened, and when the first glimmer of dawn
appeared, Tom made ready to hop off on what
he hoped would be the last trip before he would
fulfil the conditions of Jason Jacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those fellows must know that everything
depends on my completion of the six round trips,
Ned,” said the young inventor as he took his
place in the car, while Meldrum and Dodge went
to the cockpit of the aeroplane. “They think
if they can put me out of business I won’t get
the money to complete the patent work and
establish the line as a practical concern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so,” agreed Ned. “But how do
you think they know that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there has been a lot of talk over the
financing of this thing. You know that,” remarked
Tom. “It isn’t extraordinary that
some of these plotters would get to hear about
it. I wish we could have held on to Schlump,
though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I! He might have given information
that would help us catch those other two—the
ones you say wore masks. I wonder who they
could be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have an idea,” said Tom. “I’ll tell you
later if my suspicions are correct. But now
we’ve got to get busy. I’m going to try to break
the time record this trip. If I do it will please
the old millionaire. Then, when we come back
from San Francisco—if we do—and make it
somewhere near the sixteen hours, he’ll put in
the rest of the cash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And believe me, we’ll need it!” exclaimed
Ned, in such fervent tones that Tom asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, is our bank balance low?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it isn’t anything to boast of,” Ned
answered. “You know we had to dip into it
pretty heavily to finance this thing—not only
in building the planes but in securing the landing
fields and paying the men who look after
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it has taken a bit of money,” admitted
Tom. “But then, after we are successful, and
I’m sure we shall be, we’ll get it all back, and
more, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Ned. “Well, let’s go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He followed Ned and the others into the main
compartment of the car which had been clamped
to the aeroplane in readiness for the start.
Though Ned did not tell Tom, the finances of
the Swifts were in a very precarious state just
then. Of course the firm owned much property
and many valuable patents, but the Swift Construction
Company had drawn largely on its
credit, borrowing from the banks, and to raise
more cash meant the stretching of the credit to
a danger point. By selling some of their holdings,
cash could have been raised, certainly; but
no business man likes to sacrifice any of his
principle, and Ned was a good business man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to keep the airline going, Ned had
been forced to use some of his own money which
he had saved, though he did not tell Tom this
for fear it would worry him. And then, when
it was found that more cash was needed, Ned
had spoken of the matter to Mary Nestor,
having already gotten all Mr. Damon could
spare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take all I have!” exclaimed the girl. “I’m
glad to invest it in anything Tom has to do
with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we won’t take it all,” Ned had replied.
He knew she had quite a large sum that she had
inherited from her grandmother, and it was in
her own name. “But if you could lend a few
thousands and not worry if it was lost for a
time, we could use it nicely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it!” generously offered Mary. “But
what do you mean about being lost for a time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean that even if this airline express project
fails in the present instance,” replied Ned,
“that Tom will eventually succeed with it and
pay off his debts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course he will!” said Mary proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And even if this is a complete failure,” went
on Ned, “and we must, as a business proposition,
take that into consideration, Tom will
start something else that will pay big and he’ll
get back all he loses on this. So it isn’t as if
I were asking you to throw your money away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take all I have!” exclaimed Mary impulsively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ned was content with a comparatively
small sum. And it was on this money and some
of his own, together with what remained from
the original sale of stock, that the last two trips
were financed. If they failed—well, Ned did
not like to think of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So in blissful ignorance of the sword of failure
that was hanging over his head, suspended, as
it were, on a thin thread of dollar bills, Tom
prepared to make this last trip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hardly daylight when they hopped off,
careful watch being kept by the men at the
hangar lest, in the last moment, Schlump might
slip up and toss a bomb that would kill, injure,
and destroy. But nothing untoward happened,
and soon the plane and its accompanying car
was speeding away over the New Jersey
meadows while behind the travelers the east
grew lighter and lighter as the sun slowly
mounted in the heavens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aside from the anxiety of all on board to make
the best time possible on this trip, nothing unusual
occurred during the first lap. Tom had
to stop a quarrel between Eradicate and Koku,
for the colored man could not refrain from taunting
the giant over letting Schlump get away.
So infuriated did the big man become under the
taunts of Eradicate that he might have done
the latter an injury had not Tom sternly forbidden
all further mention of the incident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chicago was reached safely, almost half an
hour ahead of the schedule, which fact, when
Tom ascertained it, made him exclaim:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine! If we can keep that up we’ll do
better than sixteen hours to the coast. We’re
going to push the motors for all they’re capable
of from now on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better not strain ’em too much, sir,” suggested
Sam Stone, who was to pilot the <span class='it'>Eagle</span>
part of the way on the second lap. “We don’t
want to break anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Tom, “we don’t want to break
anything but records. How has everything
been here? Any signs of those rascals?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there have been one or two suspicious
fellows loitering around the hangar,” reported
the mechanician. “But we warned them away.
They didn’t blow us up, at any rate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad of that,” said Tom. “They tried
it on Long Island,” and he related the Schlump
incident. “He’ll probably wire his confederates
out here or in Denver or San Francisco to muss
us up if they can—anything to prevent this
last trip from succeeding. So we must redouble
our precautions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll do that,” agreed Stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Eagle</span> at first did even better than the
<span class='it'>Falcon</span>, and it seemed as if the hop between
Chicago and Denver would be a record-breaker.
But slight trouble developed about halfway
across the plains, and though it was remedied,
still they were forty minutes late, which not
only ate up the half hour they had gained on
the first lap, but cut ten minutes from the remaining
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we’ll make it up on the last lap!” declared
Tom, with confidence. “Push her for
all she’s got in her, boys!” he said to Dolan and
Wright, who climbed into the cockpit at Denver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They got off to a roaring start, rose high in
the air, and then headed straight for the Golden
Gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sure will be glad when the last trip is over,”
remarked Mr. Damon, who sat in the car near
Tom and Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, are you getting tired of it?” asked the
young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But my wife doesn’t speak to me, and
she says she won’t as long as I take these crazy
air trips. But I said I’d come on the last trip
with you, Tom, and I’m going to stick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I hope you don’t drop out now,”
grimly joked Ned, as he looked from an observation
window to the earth, several thousand
feet below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my feather bed, I should hope not!”
cried the odd man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom kept note of the distance traveled and
the time used, and as several hours passed and
the figures grew a pleased smile came over his
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It begins to look as if we’d make up all we
lost and more too, Ned!” he cried to his chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whistle of the tube communicating from
the car to the cockpit sent out a shrill summons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello! What is it?” called Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better come up here, Mr. Swift,”
answered the voice of Art Wright. “Dolan
seems to be knocked out and the motor is behaving
very queerly. I’m afraid it’s going to
die on us!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch25'>CHAPTER XXV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A GLORIOUS FINISH</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand by, Ned!” ordered Tom, in a low
voice. “Get ready to follow me up above,”
and the young inventor made ready to ascend
the enclosed ladder to the cockpit overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know; but it looks like dirty work.
I’m afraid they’ve got us, after all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom did not stop to answer, but quickly
ascended the ladder. Ned, in a few words, told
the others the alarming news that had come
down from the cockpit, and then stood ready to
carry out Tom’s orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young inventor, crowding into the
narrow space of the after cockpit, found Wright
managing the machinery, for the planes had
a dual control system. In the forward cockpit
Ted Dolan was slumped down in a heap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” cried Tom, when he
reached Dolan’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” the mechanician answered
weakly. “It’s something I ate—or else I’ve
been doped. My stomach seems caved in and
I can’t see. I’ll have to quit, Mr. Swift—sorry——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry about that!” exclaimed Tom.
“Ned and I can finish the trip—if the engine’s
all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s just the trouble,” went on Dolan,
in a weak voice. “She isn’t acting properly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to be some obstruction in the oil feed
line,” said Wright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Use the other,” Tom promptly advised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re both feeding slowly,” was the
answer. “If the oil stops, we stop too!” Tom
well knew that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You get down to the cabin, Dolan,” advised
the young inventor. “Mr. Damon will look
after you—he’s a traveling medicine chest.
But have you been eating or drinking with
strangers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing like that, Mr. Swift—no, sir! I
only ate meals I was sure of, and at the hangar
too. I never drank anything but water—not
even sodas, for I know they can knock you out
in hot weather. I think somebody got in the
hangar and doped my food.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s possible,” admitted Tom. “How about
you?” he asked the assistant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right—I can stick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we may need you later. You go
down now with Dolan and look after him, and
send Mr. Newton up here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having given these orders, Tom began looking
over the machinery. He was engaged in this
when Ned came up to help, reporting that Mr.
Damon was looking after the ill mechanician.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oil feed supply,” was the short answer.
“You run the plane, Ned, and I’ll take the pipe
down and clean it. We can run on one line
while I’m working on the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a few minutes later, when Tom had the
pipe uncoupled, that he uttered an exclamation
of anger and surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” cried Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom held out a piece of cork. It had been
stuffed into the pipe in such a way that for a
time enough oil would pass to keep the motors
running, but the cork would gradually swell and
eventually would completely clog the pipe,
shutting off all oil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without oil an engine will soon heat up,
until, because of friction, the bearings, slide
rods, pistons and cylinder walls may become
red-hot. When that occurs the engine naturally
stops. And when the engine of an aeroplane
stops the plane falls. It is not like a dirigible
that can sustain itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dirty work!” bitterly murmured Tom, as he
worked with all possible speed to replace the
pipe, for the secondary oil supply was fast failing.
The plane was losing speed rapidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody must have got in, put some sort
of dope in Dolan’s food or water, and also
clogged the pipes,” said Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right!” snapped out Tom. “But we aren’t
beaten yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they were not. By hard work the young
inventor got the other oil line cleaned, and
then the <span class='it'>Osprey</span> at once picked up speed. However,
much valuable time had been lost, and
Tom was anxious lest the motors might have
been permanently damaged by running without
sufficient oil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they must carry on now, at all hazards,
for they were within striking distance of their
goal. They at last settled down into the San
Francisco landing field after dark—a poor
record, nearly twenty hours having been consumed
since starting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky I’m not on a strict time limit for
these six trips,” commented Tom as, tired and
exhausted from work and worry, he climbed
out of the cockpit, followed by Ned. “Jacks
didn’t stipulate that we must keep to the sixteen-hour
schedule for these six trips. His only condition
was that we must fly continually from
coast to coast, with landings only at Chicago
and Denver, and we’ve done that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Through good luck and management,” commented
Ned. “But we’ve got to be mighty
careful, Tom, on the last trip back. They’ll be
out to do us if they can and spoil our chances of
getting that hundred thousand dollars from
Jacks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it! Well, we’ll do the best we
can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Extraordinary precautions were taken about
the hangar that night. Men continually patrolled
the place, and even newspaper reporters
and photographers were looked upon with suspicion.
None but those with unquestionable credentials
were allowed within the enclosure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had intended starting back to New York
about three days after his arrival, but the
accident to the oil line decided him to have the
cylinders reground and new pistons put in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want to make the last lap a record,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The delay was nerve-racking but it could not
be helped. Tom was in communication with
his father and Mary, and they, too, were eager
for his success. All was well at home, Mary
reported, and close guard was being kept on the
Long Island hangar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They may try to blow us up when we make
our last landing,” said Tom grimly, to his
manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re equal to it,” was Ned’s answer.
“What about Chicago and Denver?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m wiring the men there to be on the
watch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the overhauling of the <span class='it'>Osprey’s</span> motor
was finished, and after a test preparations for
the trip back were made. Word that this was
to be the final test of the airline express had
been broadcast, and the papers all over the
country were on the alert for news. It was
almost like a presidential election.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the half-light of a cold dawn Tom and his
friends took the air from the San Francisco
field. As they mounted upward Ned happened
to glance at a calendar hanging on the wall of
the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you know that, Tom?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That this is Friday the thirteenth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what of it?” asked the inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you believe in luck?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, when it’s with me!” Tom said, with a
chuckle. “Not otherwise. I saw a black cat
as we were taking off, and I guess that will
neutralize Friday the thirteenth. Don’t
worry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There seemed to be no cause for worry on the
first leg of the final trip. They got off very
well, and under the care of Dolan, who had recovered
from his indisposition, the <span class='it'>Osprey</span>
winged her way across the mountains like the
bird whose name she bore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were well ahead of their schedule when
they landed in Denver, and luck was with them
on the second lap, when Stone and his helper,
with occasional relief from Tom and Ned, piloted
the <span class='it'>Eagle</span> on its eastern journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Tom, old scout, it looks as if we were
going to come through with flying colors!”
cried Ned, as preparations to land in Chicago
were being made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a quick change of the car from the
<span class='it'>Eagle</span> to the <span class='it'>Falcon</span> at the Chicago field, and
Tom was about to give the signal to take off
when a man with a reflex camera came dashing
across the field. There had been a score of
newspaper pictures taken, as well as many feet
of movies, and Tom and Ned thought this
man was a late-comer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a moment, Mr. Swift—please!” he
cried, as he ran forward, his head almost inside
the camera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was used to this plea from the hard-working
newspaper picture-takers, and though
he was anxious to be off he delayed a moment.
He knew it might mean the discharge of a man
if he came back without a picture he had been
ordered to get.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A reflex camera, as those interested in
photography know, is one with a focal plane
shutter, exceedingly rapid in action. It is
much used in news photography. The operator
raises a hood, which serves the same purpose
as the black focusing cloth in the photograph
gallery. To get sharp pictures it is necessary
to focus up to the last moment. In the reflex
camera the operator can see the image of the
picture he is about to take on a ground glass.
When the focal plane shutter is released this
ground glass automatically drops out of the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in the actions of this man aroused
the suspicions of Tom. He looked at him
keenly for a moment as the fellow ran forward,
his head almost inside his camera. Then, with
a cry, Tom leaped out of the window of the car,
and, like a football tackler, threw himself on the
man. He knocked the fellow down, grabbed
the camera and threw it as far as he could in a
direction where there were no spectators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out!” yelled Tom. “It’s a bomb!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it proved, for when the “camera” landed
there was a sharp report and a puff of smoke,
followed by a shower of dirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got you, Schlump!” yelled the young
inventor. Tom twisted the fellow’s hands up
on his own back as he rolled him over on his
face and sat on the scoundrel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schlump it proved to be. He had hoped to
get close enough not to be recognized by holding
his face down in the fake camera. And he
almost succeeded, adopting the guise of a newspaper
photographer. The camera was but an
empty black box with a fake lens. Inside
Schlump held a bomb with a slight charge of
powder in it. He dared not use much for he,
himself, would be close when he hurled it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom had sensed the danger in time, and
by his prompt action had saved himself and his
friends from injury, if not death, and had saved
the plane from damage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold him! I’ll prefer charges against him
after I reach New York!” cried Tom, as police
officers hurried up and took the plotter in
charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll never get to New York!” boasted the
prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom did not let this threat worry him.
Making a hurried explanation to the police
captain in charge of the squad of officers, Tom
saw the prisoner led away and then he took his
place again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A narrow squeak, that,” commented Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a little,” admitted Tom, with a smile.
“And now for the last lap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Falcon</span> roared her way into the air amid
the cheers of the throng, and the final stage of
the journey was begun. At first it was feared
lest some hidden defect might develop in the
motor. But none did, the machinery working
perfectly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They didn’t get a chance this time,” Tom
decided. “And from the fact that Schlump
tried so desperately at the last minute to disable
 us with a bomb, shows, I think, that they
have fired their last shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was danger still in store for the
daring aviator and his friends. They had made
exceptionally good time from Chicago and were
approaching the Long Island field. Tom was
jubilant, for the record showed the best time
yet made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the field!” cried Ned, from the
after cockpit where he was helping manage
the plane. Tom had decided, as was his right,
to pilot the last stage of the journey himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right!” admitted the young inventor
as he gave a glance downward. “And there’s
a big crowd on hand to welcome us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they swung around into the wind, a puff
of smoke was seen to arise from the hangar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at that!” cried Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire!” exclaimed Tom. “They may be
trying to burn the place!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lower and lower the machine dropped, and
those aboard could see the men in charge of the
hangar making frantic signals for them not to
drop too close to the big building. Tom heeded
this advice, and swung down well away from the
increasing volume of smoke. The <span class='it'>Falcon</span> came
to a stop, and the young inventor and Ned
climbed out of the cockpit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s going on?” cried Ned to some of the
workmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two masked men set the place on fire,” was
the answer. “But we’ve caught them, and the
fire will soon be out. We were afraid you would
come too close.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” whistled Tom. “They’re keeping
up the fight until the last minute. So you
caught the masked men, did you? Good! I’ll
have a look at them in a moment. But what’s
our time, Ned? We’ve completed our schedule
and fulfilled our contract, but I’d like to know
what actual running time we made this last
trip in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned did some rapid figuring. Then he
uttered a cry of delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen hours and forty-six minutes!” was
the answer. “The best time ever made!
You’ve broken all records, Tom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad of it,” was the modest reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so am I!” cried a voice, and Mary
pressed her way through the milling throng to—well,
what she did to Tom is none of your business
nor mine, is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, young man, you did what you said you
would,” came in the rasping voice of Jason
Jacks. “Any time you want that hundred
thousand dollars, or two hundred thousand,
just let me know. I didn’t believe much in this
thing when you started, but you have proved
that you can run an airline express between
New York and San Francisco. There’s a big
future in it, I believe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” said Tom quietly. “And now
I’d like to see who those masked men are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the men were brought before the
young inventor and stripped of black face-coverings,
they proved to be none other than
Renwick Fawn and the man who variously
called himself Blodgett and Barsky—the men
who had endeavored to steal Tom’s Chest of
Secrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so!” said the young inventor.
“So it was you who were back of this, with
Kenny and Schlump. Well, we have both of
them and now we have you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I thought these two were in jail,”
said Ned wonderingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They either escaped or bribed their way to a
parole,” returned Tom. “But they’ll go back
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And back went Fawn and Barsky to the
prison from which, by means of political influence,
they had been paroled. They had
wanted revenge and had also tried, by corrupting
Kenny and Schlump, to steal the airline
express patents. But their plans had been
frustrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you really suspect, Tom, that the two
masked plotters were Fawn and Barsky?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at first,” was the answer. “Fawn has
gotten over that queer trick of throwing out his
elbow that surely would have given him away,
and both men disguised their voices when they
talked. They wanted to escape recognition,
for they knew they might be sent back to jail
on the old charges. Well, they’ll do double
time now—on the old charge, and for trying to
kidnap me, as well as setting fire to the hangar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They played a desperate game,” commented
 Ned. “To think of digging that
tunnel and going to all that work to get your
patents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They didn’t dig the tunnel,” Tom answered.
“It’s a natural one. They just made an entrance
to it near our fence—that much of the
digging alone was new. The rest was natural.
I may find a use for that same tunnel, too. It’s
a good thing to know about. And now, Ned,
I’m going to take a little vacation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You deserve it!” answered the manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the last of Tom’s enemies were caught
and sent away. Mr. Jacks was as good as his
word, and not only invested largely in the new
enterprise himself, but got his friends to do so,
so that the money Ned and Mary had put in to
bolster the sinking fortunes at the last minute
was fully repaid them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d never have let you risk your savings,
Ned, or you either, Mary, if I had known it,”
said Tom, when the story was told him. “Suppose
I had failed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I knew you wouldn’t fail!” answered
Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So did I,” whispered Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that’s that!</p>
